        "about": "This course is for anyone passionate in learning how a hardware component can be adapted at runtime to better respond to users/environment needs. This adaptation can be provided by the designers, or it can be an embedded characteristic of the system itself. These runtime adaptable systems will be implemented by using FPGA technologies.Within this course we are going to provide a basic understanding on how the FPGAs are working and of the rationale behind the choice of them to implement a desired system.\n\nThis course aims to teach everyone the basics of FPGA-based reconfigurable computing systems. We cover the basics of how to decide whether or not to use an FPGA and, if this technology will be proven to be the right choice, how to program it.\nThis is an introductory course meant to guide you through the FPGA world to make you more conscious on the reasons why you may be willing to work with them and in trying to provide you the sense of the work you have to do to be able to gain the advantages you are looking for by using these technologies.\n\nWe rely on some extra readings to provide more information on the topic covered in this course.\nPlease NOTE that most of the time, these documents are provided through the IEEE Xplore Digital Library, which means that, to access them, you have to have a valid IEEE subscriptions, either does by yourself or through your university/company.\n\nThe course has no prerequisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics and it presents technical topics by using analogizes to help also a student without a technical background to get at least a basic understanding on how an FPGA works.\nOne of the main objectives of this course is to try to democratize the understanding and the access to FPGAs technologies. FPGAs are a terrific example of a powerful technologies that can be used in different domains. Being able to bring this technologies to domain experts and showing them how they can improve their research because of FPGAs, can be seen as the ultimate objective of this course. Once a student completes this course, they will be ready to take more advanced FPGA courses. Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish Politecnico di Milano is a scientific-technological University, which trains engineers, architects and industrial designers.From 2014 Politecnico di Milano started the release of several MOOCs, developed by the service for digital learning METID (Methods and Innovative Technologies for Learning), giving everybody the chance to enhance personal skills. Nowadays the complexity of computing systems is skyrocketing. Programmers have to deal with extremely powerful computing systems that take time and considerable skills to be instructed to perform at their best. It is clear that it is not feasible to rely on human intervention to tune a system: conditions change frequently, rapidly, and unpredictably. It would be desirable to have the system automatically adapt to the mutating environment. This module analyzes the stated problem, embraces a radically new approach, and it introduces how software and hardware systems ca ben adjusted during execution. By doing this, we are going to introduce the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) technologies and how they can be (re)configured. Traditionally, computing was classified into General-Purpose Computing performed by a General-Purpose Processor (GPP) and Application-Specific Computing performed by an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). As a trade-off between the two extreme characteristics of GPP and ASIC, reconfigurable computing has combined the advantages of both. On one hand reconfigurable computing can have better performance with respect to a software implementation but paying this in terms of time to implement. On the other hand a reconfigurable device can be used to design a system without requiring the same design time and complexity compared to a full custom solution but being beaten in terms of performance. The main advantage of a reconfigurable system is its high flexibility, while its main disadvantage is the lack of a standard computing model. In this module we are presenting a first definition of reconfigurable computing, describing the rationale behind it and introducing how this field has been influenced by the introduction of the FPGAs. From the mid-1980s, reconfigurable computing has become a popular field due to the FPGA technology progress. An FPGA is a semiconductor device containing programmable logic components and programmable interconnects but no instruction fetch at run time, that is, FPGAs do not have a program counter. In most FPGAs, the logic components can be programmed to duplicate the functionality of basic logic gates or functional Intellectual Properties (IPs). FPGAs also include memory elements composed of simple flip-flops or more complex blocks of memories. Hence, FPGA has made possible the dynamic execution and configuration of both hardware and software on a single chip. This module provides a detailed description of FPGA technologies starting from a general description down to the discussion on the low-level configuration details of these devices, to the bitstream composition and the description of the configuration registers. FPGA design tools must provide a design environment based on digital design concepts and components (gates, flip-flops, MUXs, etc.). They must hide the complexities of placement, routing and bitstream generation from the user. This module is not going through these steps in details, an entire course will be needed just for this, but it is important at least to have an idea of what it is happening behind the scene to better understand the complexity of the processes carried out by the tools you are going to use. Within this context, this module guides you through a simple example, which is abstracting the complexity of the underlying FPGA, starting from the description of the circuit you may be willing to implement to the bitstream used to configure the FPGA. Before continuing in this terrific journey in the reconfigurable computing area, it can be useful to define a common language. Obviously, some of these terms have been already used but it is now time to better understand them and to make some order before continuing with more advanced concepts. Furthermore, as we know, FPGA configuration capabilities allow a great flexibility in hardware design and, as a consequence, they make it possible to create a vast number of different reconfigurable systems. These can vary from systems composed of custom boards with FPGAs, often connected to a standard PC or workstation, to standalone systems including reconfigurable logic and General Purpose Processors, to System-on-Chip's, completely implemented within a single FPGA mounted on a board, with only few physical components for I/O interfacing.  There are different models of reconfiguration, and a scheme to classify them is presented in this module. We can consider this module as a transitional/turning point module. We have been exposed to some terminology and concepts and we are now ready to move forward. To do this, we need to combine all the pieces of the puzzles together and to invest a bit at looking at the overall picture, and this is exactly what this module has been designed for. The reconfiguration capabilities of FPGAs give the designers extended flexibility in terms of hardware maintainability. FPGAs can change the hardware functionalities mapped on them by taking the application offline, downloading a new configuration on the FPGA (and possibly new software for the processor, if any) and rebooting the system. Reconfiguration in this case is a process independent of the execution of the application. A different approach is the one that considers reconfiguration of the FPGA as part of the application itself, giving it the capability of adapting the hardware configured on the chip resources according to the needs of a particular situation during the execution time. In this case we are referring to this reconfiguration as dynamic reconfiguration and the reconfiguration process is seen as part of the application execution, and not as a stage prior to it. This module illustrates a particular technique, which is extending the previous two, that has been viable for most recent FPGA devices, Partial Dynamic Reconfiguration. To fully understand what this technique is, the concepts of reconfigurable computing, static and dynamic reconfiguration, and the taxonomy of dynamic reconfiguration itself must be analyzed. In this way partial dynamic reconfiguration can be correctly placed in the set of system development techniques that it is possible to implement on a modern FPGA chip. After presenting different solutions proposed to design and implement dynamic reconfigurable systems, this module will describe a general and complete design methodology that can be followed as a guideline for designing reconfigurable computing systems. To design and implement a reconfigurable computing system, designers need Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools for system design and implementation, such as a design analysis tool for architecture design, a synthesis tool for hardware construction, a simulator for hardware behavior simulation, and a placement and routing tool for circuit layout. We may build these tools ourselves or we can also use commercial tools and platforms for reconfigurable system design. The first choice implies a considerable investment in terms of both time and effort to build a specific and optimized solution for the given problem, while the second one allows the re-use of knowledge, cores, and software to reach a good solution to the same problem more rapidly. This module is guiding the students through an historical view on how CAD frameworks evolved through the years. This is done to show how fast the technology is evolving and the rationale behind the choice made to improve the users experience when working with an FPGA-based system. Not only commercial tools are described, but also the personal journey done by the course instructor and his research team, starting from his early days as a PhD up to the research challenges they are nowadays working on. We are working at the edge of the research in the area of reconfigurable computing. FPGA technologies are not used only as standalone solutions/platforms but are now included into cloud infrastructures. They are now used both to accelerate infrastructure/backend computations and exposed as-a-Service that can be used by anyone. Within this context we are facing the definition of new research opportunities and technologies improvements and the time cannot be better under this perspective. What it is needed now is new platform creation tools, monitoring and profiling infrastructure, better runtime management systems, static and dynamic workload partitioning, just to name a few possible areas of research. This module is concluding this course but posing interesting questions towards possible future research directions that may also point the students to other Coursera courses on FPGAs.",

        "about": "This course will review the drivers of healthcare cost and solutions that have been proposed to address cost, quality and value of health care. Many point blame for high costs on payment models that pay healthcare providers for every service they provide to patients, essentially paying more for volume and service intensity. This is called a Fee for Service (FFS) payment model. Some solutions, arguably the more sustainable solutions, are the combined strategies of new payment models, care management, insurance plan designs, consumer engagement tools, and technology. Using that information we will explore various situations, showcasing coordinated care and payment strategies that can be implemented to improve patient health and the cost of delivery of healthcare services.\n\nBy the end of this course, the learner should be able to: \n\n1. Identify the drivers and trends of healthcare spending from the perspective of various stakeholders, including medical providers, insurers, government and private purchasers and payments\n2. Critically assess the impact of strategic and financial approaches that have been put in place by the ACA and the various modifications. \n3. Evaluate how healthcare payment models currently work and the new direction that value-based payment is taking.\n4.Identify how financial and non-financial metrics can be appropriately combined to improve a healthcare stakeholders\u2019 value proposition. Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish Founded in 1898, Northeastern is a global research university with a distinctive, experience-driven approach to education and discovery. The university is a leader in experiential learning, powered by the world\u2019s most far-reaching cooperative education program. The spirit of collaboration guides a use-inspired research enterprise focused on solving global challenges in health, security, and sustainability. This week's focus will be on understanding the various stakeholders in healthcare. We will review the \"math\" surrounding healthcare costs and how it can fluctuate. Healthcare drivers will be reviewed to identify trends. As you move through the weekly material, I encourage you to think about the impact that the drivers have on the delivery of the healthcare services.  This week we will describe the various elements which underline health insurance within the United States. For example, third party payment structures and risk pooling, to name a few. This week we will focus some time on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which is a very complex piece of legislation. Special attention will be made on provisions of the ACA that impact insurance markets, financing, healthcare costs, and payment models.  This week will continue to \"follow the money\". We will focus much of our attention on the shortcomings of a Fee-for-Service payment model. Our attention will shift to alternative payment models that have been implemented, allowing for certain comparisons to be made. Lastly, we will review some results that have been achieved because of the new payment models. This week I will leave you by asking, If we know that the Fee-for-Service payment model is dysfunctional, why is it continuously used?  This week we shift our focus from reviewing current payment models and strategies to applying some of the models and concepts to \"real-world\" scenarios. We will use fictitious examples, as well as published articles to bring together all of the concepts. As with most things, there is not one single answer to solving the healthcare cost, quality, and value problems. I encourage you to think \"outside of the box\" and as always, \"follow the money!\" This Specialization will provide learners with the knowledge and skills to recognize key shifts in the industry and to have an agile perspective on how these shifts might impact their organizations. Learners will be exposed to the key drivers in the global healthcare industry today so they might apply what they have learned to help their organizations.",

We will teach you about the specifics of protecting labour rights as human rights, will guide you through the history and future of the International Labour Organization, and will analyse the concept of corporate social responsibility and fundamental workers\u2019 rights. \nIn short, the course is designed to provide you with a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical skills on international labour law. After completing our course, you will not only understand the content of the standards and instruments involved, but also know how to use the procedures of the international system to secure those rights.

        "about": "According to legend, inscribed on walls of the temple on the sacred site of Delphi in Ancient Greece were two premier injunctions: NOTHING IN EXCESS, and KNOW THYSELF. This course will be an examination of the latter injunction in an effort to discover what self-knowledge is, why it might be valuable, and what, if any, limitations it might face. What is missing from a person lacking in self-knowledge that makes her less wise, virtuous, or competent in certain areas than others who have this capacity, and what if anything might she do to fill that gap?  Historical sources as well as recent research in philosophy, experimental social psychology, and neuroscience will inform our investigation, in the course of which we will become students of our own dreams, and cultivate some meditative practices.Learning Outcomes: \nLearners will gain familiarity with prominent themes from Western, classical Chinese, and Buddhist approaches to our knowledge of ourselves. In the course of doing so, they will gain an appreciation of the relation of self-knowledge to wisdom, of the value of intellectual humility, as well as of methods of learning about oneself that do not depend on introspection. \n\nLearners will also become familiar with contemporary research in experimental social psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience into the emotions, the unconscious, the role of affect in decision making, and self-deception. They will also gain an appreciation of a challenge to the assumption of a coherent, unified self that derives from the Buddhist tradition.\n\n---\nThis course was created by a partnership between The University of Edinburgh and Humility & Conviction and Public Life Project, an engaged research project  based at the University of Connecticut and funded by a generous grant from the John Templeton Foundation.

He tells the jury to their faces that they only charged him because they don't like that he forces them to confront uncomfortable truths. Somewhat unsurprisingly, the jury sentences him to death. Socrates accepts the sentence unfazed, famously stating that he'd rather die than stop making people think, as 'an unexamined life is not worth living'. In this module we will examine this dictum and ask: was Socrates right to throw shade on the unexamimed life? Are you dreaming right now? How do you know you're not? Rene Descartes set himself a pretty titanic task: to doubt absolutely everything he cannot be certain of - even that the world exists! - and then try to see if we can rebuild our knowledge of ourselves and the world only from what we can be really certain of. In the process, he formulated some provocative thoughts on the radical separation of the mind from the body. Descartes' dualistic picture of the mind-body relation was highly influential for centuries. A vocal minority of thinkers challenged dualism, but only in the Twentieth Century did Gilbert Ryle manage to discern how Descartes' dualistic reasoning went wrong. In understanding Ryle's approach, we will also gain an appreciation of how know-how is a legitimate form of knowledge, and of how one way of gaining self-knowledge is by looking outward rather than looking inward. Is there such a thing as a human nature? And if there is, how can we know what it is? In this module we will look at how the concept of human nature is used and potentially misused, and what can all this tell us about ourselves. And finally: can human nature be changed? ",

        "about": "What is \u201cprogress\u201d? How do we decide when we\u2019re moving forward and not taking steps backward? And how do we explore the idea of progress around public sites of memory? This Teach-Out is an invitation to think about what progress means, and how you can look for it wherever you are\u2014in your city, community, or neighborhood\u2014and reflect upon your own ideas about the place you live in.Changes in the built environment of our communities are themselves the result of human actions and intentions, such as municipal planning, commercial enterprises, or communities transforming their own space. In other words, in our cities we can see the results of our plans\u2014our attempts to create and shape the future. Neighbors, political groups, corporations, governments, schools, and other organizations, they all shape the community, leaving traces that allow us to see in what directions they transformed our lives. \n\nThis Teach-Out will ask the following questions:\n\u2022\tWhat are the forces that shape and change the places we inhabit? \n\u2022\tHow do people connect with places in our modern cities? \n\u2022\tDo places progress? \n\u2022\tHow can we measure in them whether there is any \u201cprogress\u201d? \n\nWe will interview a number of people who work in Atlanta, Georgia, but the questions and places we will see here are comparable to many of other places in the world on what it means to progress. In this Teach-Out you will learn how to find the history of public spaces in any community and how to reflect upon the idea of progress. Finally, you can join a conversation to discuss what has been explored, uncovered, and possibly transformed both within ourselves and our communities.\n\nA Teach-Out is: \n\u2013 an event \u2013 it takes place over a fixed, short period of time \n\u2013 an opportunity \u2013 it is open for free participation to everyone around the world \n\u2013 a community \u2013 it will be joined by a large number of diverse individuals \n\u2013 a conversation \u2013 an opportunity to give and take ideas and information from people \n\nThis community learning event invites participants from around the world to come together in conversation with the Emory campus community, including faculty experts. This Teach-Out is part of Emory\u2019s commitment to engage the local and global community in exploring and understanding problems, events, and phenomena most important to our society. \n\nOriginating from University of Michigan (Teach-Out.org), Teach-Outs are short learning experiences focused on a specific current issue. Attendees will come together over a few days not only to learn about a subject or event but also to gain skills. Teach-Outs are open to the world and are designed to bring together individuals with wide-ranging perspectives in respectful and deep conversation. These events are an opportunity for diverse learners and a multitude of experts to come together to ask questions of one another and explore new solutions to the pressing concerns of our global community. Come, join the conversation! Subtitles: English Subtitles: English Emory University, located in Atlanta, Georgia, is one of the world's leading research universities.

        "about": "I am a professor and mental health researcher and educator, and I\u2019ve been working in the field for over 15 years. Like so many of my colleagues, however, I was unprepared for the wave of mental health challenges that would face our society in 2020. From COVID-19 and the devastating economic impacts of the pandemic to racial justice protests, widespread natural disasters, our current cultural moment presents unprecedented mental health concerns, and particularly for marginalized communities. For this reason, I led a field-wide call to action for mental health research and treatment that resulted in this #TalkMentalIllness course. I had the opportunity to speak to over 30 experts from different domains in psychology research, practice, and popular public figures and to discuss the causes and cutting-edge treatments for many serious disorders, the stigma surrounding mental illness in our culture, systemic inequality in mental health treatment, and the mental health challenges of today.#talkmentalillness curates the interviews from the Mental Health Experts series into an accessible learning experience that will help you have conversations about mental health. Talking about mental illness is both the content and desired outcome of this course, as you will use what you learn from my interviews with mental health experts to guide your own discussions about mental health challenges and treatments with family members, friends, colleagues, and other people in your life. The course will begin by presenting a core set of definitions for mental illness and analyzing the stigma associated with it. We will then apply these topics to specific psychological disorders, including anxiety and mood disorders, eating disorders, suicide, substance use, and psychosis. We will then consider how these issues disproportionately impact marginalized groups and communities of color. The course will conclude by considering innovative approaches to psychological treatments and how the pursuit and science of happiness inform mental health and wellness.\n \nThis course is part of a broader educational mission to share the science of mental illness with both students and the public, both locally and globally. I have designed and created it in collaboration with the Office for Academic Innovation and Libraries\u2019 Media Services Team at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\n- June Gruber Subtitles: English Subtitles: English CU-Boulder is a dynamic community of scholars and learners on one of the most spectacular college campuses in the country. As one of 34 U.S. public institutions in the prestigious Association of American Universities (AAU), we have a proud tradition of academic excellence, with five Nobel laureates and more than 50 members of prestigious academic academies. In the first week of #talkmentalillness, you will learn about public perceptions of mental illness and analyze the stigma associated with it. This week features interviews with leading public figures including Temple Grandin, public advocate for autism and author of The \"Autistic Brain: Thinking Across the Spectrum\"; Kay Redfield Jamison, international bipolar disorder expert and author of \"Unquiet Mind\" and \"Touched with Fire\"; Stephen Hinshaw, author of \"Mark of Shame\" and award-winning clinical psychology professor and Gordon Nagayama-Hall who discusses the influence of culture on mental health perception, diagnosis and treatment. Optional interviews include Mitchell Prinstein on communicating mental health to the public and Aaron Fisher on precision behavioral health. The second week of #talkmentalillness will feature the latest insights into specific psychological disorders. This includes first-hand insights from Greg Siegle on the brain and depression, Linda Craighead on eating-related disorders, Bunmi Olatunji, an expert in the cognitive mechanisms and treatment for anxiety disorders, and Sheri Johnson, who is at at the forefront of emotion-related impulsivity and bipolar disorder. Optional interviews include Lee Anna Clark on personality disorders, Jutta Joormann on depression and cognition, Wendy Heller on anxiety disorders, Jonathan Rottenberg on depression and emotion, and Judy Garber on internalizing disorders. The third week of #talkmentalillness delves into severe mental illness, including suicide, schizophrenia, substance abuse, and psychopathy. This includes first-hand discussion on the critical topic of suicide with MacArthur Genius awardee Matthew Nock, alcohol use disorders with Lara Ray, Diane Gooding examining the psychosis spectrum and early warning signs, and Abigail Marsh, author of \"The Fear Factor\", who speaks on psychopathy. Optional interviews include former president of the Association for Psychological Science, Robert Levenson, sharing his first-person observations into severe mental illness, suicide treatment and prevention expert Lauren Weinstock, and Deanna Barch providing new understandings of motivational systems that underlie and give rise to schizophrenia. The fourth week of #talkmentalillness considers how mental illness disproportionately impacts marginalized groups and communities of color, as well vulnerable youth and family communities. Steven Lopez will tackle mental health disparities in Latinx communities, Lauren Ng discusses the field of global mental health and disproportionate impacts in developing nations, April Thames addresses mental health disparities among minoritized groups, and Kate McLaughlin discusses the relationship between stress and trauma as risk factors predicting greater mental health vulnerability.  Optional interviews include Darby Saxbe on family systems and hormones, Jane Mendle on puberty and mental health, and Jessica Borelli on parent-child relationships. The fifth and final week of #talkmentalillness considers innovative evidence-based approaches to psychological treatments and how the pursuit and science of happiness and emotional wellness informs how we think about mental health. This includes interviews with and Laurie Santos, instructor of the most popular class on the science of well-being in Yale University\u2019s history and director of the Happiness Lab podcast, Director of the Greater Good Science Center and science of happiness expert Dacher Keltner, international cognitive-behavior therapy expert Jacqueline Persons and Thomas Insel, director and founder of Mindstrong Health and former director of the National Institute of Mental Health. Optional interviews include James Gross on emotion regulation and mental health, Steven Hollon on cutting-edge treatments for depression, and Amelia Aldao on cognitive therapy for anxiety. Week 5 concludes with the final project for the course. For the final project for #talkmentalillness, you will share what you've learned in the course or a personal story related to mental illness on social media.",

Generally speaking, when it comes to changing (or not) the current spirit and state of affairs of a given society or community, some people show themselves as idealists, and they can even inspire others. At the same time, some other people are traditionalists, and some are just neutral about how things are. In this guided-project you will develop an agent-based model using NetLogo that tries to use these personas to touch and generate insights around theses questions. And while doing so, you will gain some hands-on knowledge on model building and debugging.\n\nNote: This project works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

        "about": "Acute stroke is a time-dependent medical emergency. In acute ischemic stroke, the first objective is to restore brain flow using sistemic thrombolytic treatment and, in patients with large vessel occlusion, by endovascular treatment. In hemorrhagic stroke there are also specific treatments that can improve the clinical outcome.The sooner the initiation of all these therapies the higher the clinical benefit. Thus,  the organization of Stroke Code systems coordinated between emergency medical systems and hospitals is crucial to achieve early medical attention and treament.\nNeurological scales facilitate stroke recognition at both hospital and pre-hospital levels and provide valuable information of stroke severity. The RACE scale is a prehospital scale validated as a tool to identify patients with suspected large vessel occlusion who are potential candidates for endovascular treatment. \n\nThis course aims to update general knowledge in acute stroke and currently available treatments, to review the protocol\nof the Stroke Code and, finally, to train in the use of the RACE scale.\n\nThe target profile of this course is aimed to all health professionals working in the field of emergencies.

Subtitles: English Subtitles: English IBM is the global leader in business transformation through an open hybrid cloud platform and AI, serving clients in more than 170 countries around the world. Today 47 of the Fortune 50 Companies rely on the IBM Cloud to run their business, and IBM Watson enterprise AI is hard at work in more than 30,000 engagements. IBM is also one of the world\u2019s most vital corporate research organizations, with 28 consecutive years of patent leadership. Above all, guided by principles for trust and transparency and support for a more inclusive society, IBM is committed to being a responsible technology innovator and a force for good in the world. For more information about IBM visit: www.ibm.com Logistic regression is one of the most studied and widely used classification algorithms, probably due to its popularity in regulated industries and financial settings. Although more modern classifiers might likely output models with higher accuracy, logistic regressions are great baseline models due to their high interpretability and parametric nature. This module will walk you through extending a linear regression example into a logistic regression, as well as the most common error metrics that you might want to use to compare several classifiers and select that best suits your business problem. K Nearest Neighbors is a popular classification method because they are easy computation and easy to interpret. This module walks you through the theory behind k nearest neighbors as well as a demo for you to practice building k nearest neighbors models with sklearn. This module will walk you through the main idea of how support vector machines construct hyperplanes to map your data into regions that concentrate a majority of data points of a certain class. Although support vector machines are widely used for regression, outlier detection, and classification, this module will focus on the latter. Decision tree methods are a common baseline model for classification tasks due to their visual appeal and high interpretability. This module walks you through the theory behind decision trees and a few hands-on examples of building decision tree models for classification. You will realize the main pros and cons of these techniques. This background will be useful when you are presented with decision tree ensembles in the next module. Ensemble models are a very popular technique as they can assist your models be more resistant to outliers and have better chances at generalizing with future data. They also gained popularity after several ensembles helped people win prediction competitions. Recently, stochastic gradient boosting became a go-to candidate model for many data scientists.This model walks you through the theory behind ensemble models and popular tree-based ensembles. Some classification models are better suited than others to outliers, low occurrence of a class, or rare events. The most common methods to add robustness to a classifier are related to stratified sampling to re-balance the training data. This module will walk you through both stratified sampling methods and more novel approaches to model data sets with unbalanced classes.\u00a0",

This week starts your journey into understanding computer science. You will think about how computer science can help you understand the technology you use every day and you will also learn one of the most important concepts in computer science: abstraction.  This is the second part of the introductory overview of the course. This module will give a high-level overview of the way typical web applications work. It will introduce three key concepts: networks, security and web applications, and will apply them \u2013 together with the concepts introduced in the previous week \u2013 in order to understand a notional web application. In this module we will cover three key concepts: data storage, data representation and data compression. You will learn about the ways in which data are represented and stored in a computer, including the use of bit patterns to represent different types of data, the types of hardware used to represent data, and data compression algorithms. You will use this understanding to reason about computer systems and solve problems.  In this topic students will learn about the functioning of operating systems, the various components of operating systems,  the relationship between operating systems and applications, and security issues around operating systems. They will use this understanding to reason about computer systems and solve problems. In this topic students will learn about the ways operating systems manage the demands of multiple processes executing on a computer. They will apply this knowledge to practical problems. This topic will introduce students to the functioning of computer networks and network protocols. It will also address issues of network security. In this topic students will learn about the structure and function of the internet. This will include the ways in which multiple networks are connected to allow global communication and also the functioning of client server systems such as websites. In this topic students will learn about the ways in which data are represented and stored in a computer, including the use of bit patterns to represent different types of data, the types of hardware used to represent data and data compression algorithms.

It is now being offered globally as one of Peking University\u2019s MOOCs. \n\nAddressing students' interests in 20th century Western Music Culture and incorporating music theory, the course examines 20th century Western music. By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing students\u2019 understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding students\u2019 horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.

Welcome to the third course in the Unity Certified Programmer exam preparation series. For the first week of this course, you'll begin to build out the Stealth game. It's a third-person, 3D game with stealth mechanics, and the first thing you'll do is implement the navigation of the \"enemy,\" a robot sentry. The enemy agent can now move around the level, but we need to let our a player character or avatar move. In this week's lessons, you'll implement character animation and a sophisticated camera system to track it. Next, you'll create a set of environmental interactions that will give context to the character and enemy movement and help complete the core interaction loop for the Stealth game. Finally for this course, you'll give the player the ability to look beyond what the main camera shows by creating a mini-map that renders in a corner of the screen. Your work on this mini-map will be reviewed by your peers for your final graded assessment of the course. This is Unity\u2019s official series of courses designed to prepare you for the Unity Certified Programmer exam, the certification for entry- to mid-level Unity programmers. You\u2019ll gain practice and experience in each of the topics covered in the exam through hands-on problem solving challenges. You\u2019ll build two complete Unity projects end-to-end, implementing core interactivity, supporting systems, and platform optimizations This series of courses is for Unity programmers with 1-2 years of experience who are ready to bring their existing skills up to a professional standard.",

This module will reflect upon some of those pieces and build upon them with examples of disruption, and how 3D printing is changing the world of manufacturing and product development.. The world is full of challenges and problems that need to be solved.  Oftentimes, many issues get completely overlooked due to the market size being relatively small in comparison to the rest of the world.  These marginalized issues are left without solutions, but with the advent of 3D printing, we have an opportunity to solve many of these issues. Creating an idea that is designed for 3D printing is often more difficult than it may seem.  There are many considerations to be made, and this module is an opportunity for you to explore those ideas further though DFAM (Design for Additive Manufacturing). To finish out the capstone course, let's look back a bit at the hardware course and consider some implications of your design and printing process.  Even the best designs may be difficult to implement if print speeds are not appropriate for the throughput needed, or if material properties are not able to match the requirements of the application.

In this welcome module, you will become familiar with the course, your classmates, and our learning environment. In module 1, you will learn about \u201cdesktop\u201d 3D printing as opposed to any other sort of 3D printing. You\u2019ll learn this and more by exploring the history behind the creation of desktop 3D printers, overviews of the different types of desktop 3D printers, expose a few of the common misconceptions about them, and explore where you might gain access to them for yourself, including details to help you make an informed decision about the class of desktop 3D printer hardware that suits your specific needs and budget. From a distance, the process of 3D printing looks like magic. Step closer and see how all of the core systems and components work together to fabricate real physical objects from digital design files. We make our first of two excursions \u201cunder the hood\u201c to look at the core systems and components that together and in parallel bring function to 3D printers.  Now that we have an understanding of the controls and motion system. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the extrusion process and what makes 3D printer filament so special.  Let\u2019s learn about the materials and processing that they go through when being printed.  Now that you have looked closely at the fundamental physical systems and components involved with how desktop 3D printers function, and how they can be operated in \u201cnormal\u201d situations, it is time to explore the processes involved with preparing digital objects and creating the job files (G-Code, or variant) that will drive the fabrication process.  Okay, you\u2019ve taken a broad view of desktop machines in the context of the history of 3D printers, very close view of the specific components and systems underneath the hood, and have crossed back-and-forth across the virtual-physical divide -- now it is time to spend some time seeing what it is like to use them!  In the final module we will then wrap up our exploration of operating desktop 3D printing hardware, covering the moment you hit print to fabricate a part, through to the stages that follow. We\u2019ll wrap up the course with a section highlighting approaches to technical support, troubleshooting, and preventative maintenance, as long as some recommendations for common tools, mods, and add-ons we hope to help you on your own 3D printer experiences that will follow.

This MOOC aims to train the next generation of business professionals and developers to acknowledge business\u2019 interdependency with healthy landscapes and understand the value of ecosystem resources.\n\n\u201cHistorically, we have found countless ways to justify our continued exploitation of the environment: discovery, tradition, Manifest Destiny, even Chinese hoax. But we\u2019re all out of excuses now. Each passing day swells the data on greenhouse gases and extreme weather, shrinking reservoirs and rising sea levels, and diminishing biodiversity. Our resources are finite, the window for change if not firmly shut, is certainly closing, and all life must adapt or be doomed.\u201d\n\nT\u00e9a Obreht, \nThe New Yorker, Dec. 19&26, 2016, p. 106.\n\nIt is a frightening prospect indeed \u2013 that all life on Earth must either adapt or be doomed.

But this course is also about the solutions to this problem \u2013 business driven landscape restoration.\nSo rather than leaving you powerless with the prospect Obreht puts fowards above, it is our hope that you learn how you can be part of the solution to making sure that Planet Earth still provides a safe and habitable home for future generations. \nWe must act big and we must act now.\nWith this course we want to pass on valuable knowledge and teach you useful skills that you can apply in your professional life that will enable you to tackle the issue of landscape degradation and restoration. \nThe issue is urgent, so let\u2019s dive right into it.\n\nThis MOOC is developed by the ENABLE partnership, which is co-funded by the ERASMUS+ programme of the European Commission and involves a diverse, international group of organizations including Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, Commonland, United Nations University Land Restoration Training Programme, the Spanish National Research Council and Estoril Global Conferences.

We will challenge you to become a professional who is not afraid to work as a game-changer in transformative collaboration aiming at landscape management and restoration.                                                           In this first video Simon Moolenaar from Commonland will give you an overview of the content and skills you can expect to learn about in each week, and what you can aim to take away at the end of the course. Simon will introduce you to one of the principal concepts of this course; landscape degradation and the scale of this problem globally. He will then show you the many dimensions there are to the relation between landscapes and businesses. Specifically, he will illustrate how there is both an economic cause for landscape degradation but also an economic logic to the solution \u2013 business-driven landscape restoration. You will be introduced to the Land Degradation Neutrality target which is one of seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations. Simon will explain how the SDGs can be used to raise awareness and mobilise the private and public sector for action. Another tool for landscape restoration you will learn about is the 4 returns framework developed by Commonland. This framework is about large-scale landscape restoration with 4 returns on investment: return of inspiration, return of natural capital, return of social capital and return of financial capital. We will then return to this framework and explore it in greater depth in the fourth week of the course.     Let's get started! Now that you have seen how important it is to restore degraded landscape you might ask yourself \u2013 how do I go about doing that? How do I even know if a landscape is degraded or not? How much can I expect to restore? What is it exactly in the landscape that we are restoring? You need to be able to answer these types of questions before you even start thinking about making a cost-benefit analysis or calculating a loss-profit statement for a restoration project. In the upcoming videos you will learn how to recognise healthy landscapes from degraded ones, and the types of interventions needed to recover degraded ecosystems. It is essential to have a good grasp of the natural processes of the land in order to be able to make decisions as an investor, business manager, or employer that maximise the impact of every dollar invested in restoring a landscape.  How much is a plot of land worth? Is it worth as much as the crops grown on it? Is it worth as much as the next farmer is willing to pay for it? Who incurs the cost of damages to the land? What if you asked yourself this question:  \"What if I had never seen this before? What if I knew I would never see it again?\u201d If you knew you could never see a plot of land again, would its value change? Rachel Carson, a pioneer of the global environmental movement, posed these questions to the readers of her ground-breaking book Silent Spring, encouraging them to open their eyes to the rampant problem of degradation of the natural environmental happening all around us. The world of business thrives on quantifying just about anything. If we want to make landscape restoration a financially sustainable activity then we need economic valuation methods to put a price tag on both the value of landscapes and ecosystem services, as well as on the cost and foregone revenues from landscape degradation. In this week, we will build on what you learned last week about the natural aspects of landscapes \u2013 to learn how to calculate the potential savings we can make by avoiding further degradation and the profits we stand to make from restored landscapes.   In this week, you will learn about a way of approaching landscape restoration projects involving business, termed the 4 returns approach. We will travel to the Commonland projects in South Africa, Spain, Australia, and The Netherlands to hear from farmers and business developers how degraded landscapes can be restored while simultaneously creating sustainable businesses that generate employment and income for local communities. Through these examples you will learn what kind of roles are involved and what skills are needed to initiate and carry out this kind of restoration projects. Moreover, you will learn what kind of stakeholders to involve in a landscape restoration partnership and which phases a 4 returns restoration project goes through. We hope that these vivid examples of real-life restoration projects serve as a jumping board for you to play your own role in such a project. \u201cTo sin by silence, when we should protest, // Makes cowards out of men.\u201d \t\t\tElla Wheeler Wilcox, Protest, 1914 Poems of ProblemsThese words are the start of a piercing poem titled Protest written by American poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox. This week you learn about wicked problems and why we can consider land degradation to be a wicked problem. The wickedness of land degradation often makes us feel powerless and we might shy away from even beginning to tackle it. In exactly that moment we should heed Wilcox\u2019s advice, and speak up and act, for otherwise we may later be judged by ourselves and our heirs to this planet as the cowards who were not brave enough to act and do something about landscape degradation.First, we will examine what wicked problems are and the characteristics by which we can dissect them. You will learn about the way in which the state, civil society, and private sector play a role in wicked problems.Now, all this talk of wickedness may leave you feeling gloomy. Fear not. You will also learn about a specific tool that allows you to speak up and act as a professional addressing landscape degradation. That tool is partnerships. We will examine how you can build a strategic and effective partnership by recruiting the right partners, forging the right relationships and atmosphere amongst them, and distributing roles and responsibility in an equitable manner. We are drawing close to the end of this course on business-driven landscape restoration. You have been introduced to thinking about landscapes as a scientist and as a business professional.In this week we will introduce several new tools. First, we will study the business model canvas, which can be readily understood and applied by biologists, geologists, investors, and managers. The canvas is a great tool for communication, especially in landscape restoration projects where different stakeholders work together. The business model canvas gets at the heart of what value such a project will create, how and for whom, and how the project will generate revenues to be financially sustainable. \nSecond, we will also introduce an alternative version of the business model canvas, the PPP canvas - public-private partnership canvas - which is particularly useful when the stakeholders of the project come from different industries and disciplines, and from all three sectors of society; the state, civil society, and private sector. \nLastly, we will look at sustainable business model innovation which is process of identifying, designing, and implementing a business model that generates sustainable value for the firm, its stakeholders, and the socio-ecological system in which it is embedded. \u201cHistorically, we have found countless ways to justify our continued exploitation of the environment: discovery, tradition, Manifest Destiny, even Chinese hoax. But we\u2019re all out of excuses now. Each passing day swells the data on greenhouse gases and extreme weather, shrinking reservoirs and rising sea levels, and diminishing biodiversity. Our resources are finite, the window for change if not firmly shut, is certainly closing, and all life must adapt or be doomed.\u201d By now you may be both dismayed by the immense threat that landscape degradation is to human and economic development and the future of habitable life on Planet Earth, but also inspired by the prospect of designing and implementing business-driven solutions that will halt and reverse the problem. As the quote says, we must adapt in order to escape the dooming prospect we face if we take no action. Over the course of the past six weeks we have examined landscapes from a ecological and economic perspectives. You have been seen examples of real-life restoration projects and been introduced to methods such as Total Economic Valuation, the 4 returns approach, partnerships, business model canvas, and PPPcanvas. Now you have the opportunity to apply the knowledge and methods you have accumulated to a restoration project that is currently ongoing. The Commonland organisation has been working to restore degraded land in Southern Spain with some progress but setbacks as well. It is now soliciting your help in this project! Study the case carefully and the assignment information. Then be as analytical and creative as you can to develop a solution. Your fellow students will review your solution and you will be asked to do the same for a few other fellow students.Good luck!",

        "about": "Metals are present everywhere around us and are one of the major materials upon which our economies are built. Economic development is deeply coupled with the use of metals. During the 20th century, the variety of metal applications in society grew rapidly. In addition to mass applications such as steel in buildings and aluminium in planes, more and more different metals are in use for innovative technologies such as the use of the speciality metal indium in LCD screens.  A lot of metals will be needed in the future. It will not be easy to provide them. In particular in emerging economies, but also in industrialised countries, the demand for metals is increasing rapidly. Mining and production activities expand, and with that also the environmental consequences of metal production.  \n\nIn this course, we will explore those consequences and we will also explore options to move towards a more sustainable system of metals production and use. We will focus especially on the options to reach a circular economy for metals: keeping metals in use for a very long time, to avoid having to mine new ones.  \n\nThis course is based on the reports of the Global Metals Flows Group of the International Resource Panel that is part of UN Environment.  An important aspect that will come back each week, are the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the SDGs. Those are ambitious goals to measure our progress towards a more sustainable world. We will use the SDGs as a touching stone for the assessment of the metals challenge, as well as the solutions we present in this course to solve that challenge. Subtitles: English Subtitles: English Leiden University is one of Europe's foremost research universities. This prominent position gives our graduates a leading edge and prepares them for careers both within and outside of academia. Leiden University is the oldest university in the Netherlands, founded in 1575. Our motto is: Praesidium Libertatis (Bastion of Liberty) - Freedom of spirit, thought and expression. Leiden University has a campus in Leiden and The Hague, with 7 faculties, 47 Bachelor Programmes, 79 Master Programmes and nearly 30,000 students. Welcome to the course! This first module aims at introducing you to the main topic of the MOOC and to the teaching staff that you will be seeing throughout the whole course. Before you start with the first lessons we encourage you to have a look at our introductory materials and to introduce yourself in the forum in order to meet your classmates.  In Week 1, you will be introduced to the world of metals. What are they, what are their properties, what are they used for and how essential are they? We will address the difference between major and minor metals. Major metals are used in large basic applications such as buildings, cars, pipes, cables, bridges, trains and airplanes. Minor metals that are used mostly in all kinds of electronics and in new technologies, for example for wind and solar energy. The amounts used are much smaller. The minor metals have more attention in the news, because of problems with the supply from international trade, and are subject to criticality assessments. The major metals, on the other hand, are even more important, although less in the centre of attention. Without them, society would fall apart. In this course, we will focus mostly on those major metals. We also introduce the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. These SDGs are agreed on by all nations that are part of the UN, and outline goals for the future of the global society. They include goals on economic development, social development, health and the environment and form a powerful framework to judge developments in resource use, including metal use.   In week 2, the metals challenge is outlined. Metals are indispensable for society, but they are also associated with environmental impacts, especially related to climate change. The challenge is defined as how can we provide society with sufficient metals, now and in the future, without compromising environmental quality? An important part of the challenge is caused by the rapidly rising demand for metals. Over the 20th century demand has risen steeply, and this is expected to continue over the next decades.  In this week, we will teach the issues around metal supply, scarcity and criticality, and environmental impacts to sketch the magnitude of the metals challenge. We also will meet the apparent contradiction between some of the SDGs: we need metals to develop societies and build up the infrastructure, on the other hand, we also need to reduce environmental impacts that will only increase if we don\u2019t do anything about it. Week 3 and all subsequent weeks focus on solving the metals challenge. Obviously, we need to make changes in the metals system to reach a more sustainable situation and reconcile the different Sustainable Development Goals. When considering changes, it is important first to understand the system. We will be discussing stocks and flows of metals in society and see how they interact. In society, we do not just obey the laws of justice and economics, but also the laws of nature. It is important to realise that when contemplating solutions for the metals challenge. This week will be rather theoretical but will provide important information for the coming weeks. Week 4 is rather packed with lectures on the different options to solve the metals challenge. You will meet experts from all over the world, who will lecture on materials and product design-for-environment and design-for-recycling, on the possibilities and also the barriers for remanufacturing, and on recycling as the last, but maybe most important resort to keep the metals in use. All these options aim at keeping up the stock-in-use of metals in society, while at the same time reducing the need to mine new metals. They all have their own strengths and limitations and can be regarded as pieces of the large puzzle aiming at solving the metals challenge, or in other words, reconciling the different SDGs. In week 5, we try to get some idea of what the effectiveness could be of going for a circular economy. We do not consider all changes in society that have to be made to reach that, but simply have a look at whether or not, if we would reach a circular economy, we would indeed solve the metals challenge. Can we, theoretically, maintain supply and at the same time avoid supply problems and environmental issues in that way? And therefore, is it worthwhile pursuing a circular economy to reconcile the different SDGs? We use the case of aluminium to illustrate this. In this final week of the course, we will look briefly into the future. What can we expect for the next decades or even the next century? We\u2019ll introduce the concept of scenarios, storylines about the future that have no predictive value but have their value as imagination of what could happen, and what the consequences would be if it did. And we will apply that to our major metals. Will demand go on rising? What will happen with the environmental impacts? Does it help, from the point of view of metal production, to have a renewable energy system in the background? Will more circularity in our economy make a difference? In short, is it possible to reconcile the SDG development goals with the environmental ones? ",

Welcome to the final capstone course of the Reinforcement Learning Specialization!! This week you will read a description of a problem, and translate it into an MDP. You will complete skeleton code for this environment, to obtain a complete MDP for use in this capstone project.  This week you will select from three algorithms, to learn a policy for the environment. You will reflect on and discuss the appropriateness of each algorithm for this environment.   This week you will identify key parameters that affect the performance of your agent. The goal is to understand the space of options, to later enable you to choose which parameter you will investigate in-depth for your agent. This week, you will implement your agent using Expected Sarsa or Q-learning with RMSProp and Neural Networks. To use NNs, you will have to use a more careful stepsize selection strategy, which is why you will use RMSProp. You will also verify the correctness of your agent. This week you will identify a parameter to study, for your agent. Once you select the parameter to study, we will provide you with a range of values and specific values for other parameters. You will write a script to run your agent and environment on the set of parameters, to determine performance across these parameters. You will gain insight into the impact of parameters on agent performance. You will also get to visualize the agents that you learn. Your parameter study will consist of an array of values that we will check for correctness.  The Reinforcement Learning Specialization consists of 4 courses exploring the power of adaptive learning systems and artificial intelligence (AI).Harnessing the full potential of artificial intelligence requires adaptive learning systems. Learn how Reinforcement Learning (RL) solutions help solve real-world problems through trial-and-error interaction by implementing a complete RL solution from beginning to end.\n\nBy the end of this Specialization, learners will understand the foundations of much of modern probabilistic artificial intelligence (AI) and be prepared to take more advanced courses or to apply AI tools and ideas to real-world problems.

Along the way, we encounter Perpetua and her martyrdom in Carthage; the struggles of Augustine the bishop in North Africa; the zeal of Celtic monks and missionaries; the viciousness of the Crusades; the visions of Brigit of Sweden; and the fracturing of Christianity by Martin Luther\u2019s protest. We hear the voices of great theologians as well as of those branded heretics by the Church, a powerful reminder that the growth of Christianity is a story with many narratives of competing visions of reform and ideals, powerful critiques of corruption and venality, and exclusion of the vanquished.  The troubled history of Christian engagement with Jews and Muslims is found in pogroms and expulsions, but also in the astonishing ways in which the culture of the West was transformed by Jewish and Islamic learning.We shall explore the stunning beauty of the Book of Kells, exquisitely prepared by monks as the Vikings terrorized the coast of England. We will experience the blue light of the windows of Chartres, and ponder the opening questions of Thomas Aquinas\u2019 great Summa. We will read from the Gutenberg Bible of the fifteenth century, which heralded the revolution brought by the printing press. We will travel from Calvin\u2019s Geneva to Elizabeth\u2019s England to Trent, where a Catholic Council met to inaugurate a modern, missionary Catholic church. We will walk through the great Escorial of Philip II of Spain, hear the poetry of John of the Cross, and follow the Jesuits to Brazil and China.\n \nChristianity in the West was forged in the fires of conflict and tumult, and it brought forth both creativity and violence. It echoed with calls for God\u2019s world to be transformed, it inspired the most sublime art and architecture, yet it also revealed the power of the union of cross and sword to destroy. The course is a journey through the formation of the West as one strand of Christianity, as one chapter in a global story. It is a journey that has shaped our world.

Meet and greet your peers as well! \u201cFrom Persecution to Empire,\u201d explores the interaction between the second-century Christian Church and the Roman Empire in which it existed. After the faith\u2019s birth in Palestine, Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire with a rapidity that alarmed many Roman rulers. Persecution of Christians became common, and the experience of persecution shaped the Church. In 313 AD, the Roman Emperor Constantine ended persecution and Christianity transformed once more to become a pillar of Roman society. \u201cAugustine and the North African Church,\u201d studies two areas of early and vibrant Christian growth: Egypt and North Africa. These areas responded to intense Roman persecution by developing a theology of martyrdom. Indeed, both areas became bastions of early Christian theological thinking, with the North African Church producing the most important Christian theologian ever: Augustine of Hippo. \u201cMonastic Lives: Desert Fathers to Celtic Christianity,\u201d examines the origins of monasticism in Christianity. After the end of Roman persecution, some Christians chose to isolate themselves in the desert and deny themselves food, sleep, and material comforts. Why? And how did this movement develop into medieval monasticism? This module will explain the early roots and influence of monks and nuns in Christianity. \u201cReformers and Crusaders,\u201d focuses on Christianity during the dawn of the medieval period. Here we ask: How did Christianity respond to the new feudal world of medieval Europe? Popes, monks, and knights became essential features of the Christian faith during this period, roughly 950 \u2013 1350 AD. \u201cLearning and Light,\u201d examines two medieval Christian ideas that emerged at the same time and from the same impulse. The first is the scholastic educational initiative that dominated Christian theology and resulted in the founding of universities. The second is the beautiful, light-focused Gothic architectural style embodied in Europe\u2019s great cathedrals. These two movements remain the quintessential features of medieval Christianity. Scholasticism and cathedrals emerged not only at the same time but also from the same source: a Christian conception of the unity of all things. \u201cThree Religions: Christians, Jews & Muslims in Medieval Spain,\u201d explores medieval Spain, a place in time with enormous importance for the history of Christianity. From the eighth through the fifteenth century, Spanish society included Christians, Jews, and Muslims, and Spain became the cultural capital of all three religions. Exploring medieval Spain, we will see how Christianity competed and cooperated with the non-Christian world. The central question explored in this module is: How should we remember the cultural interactions among Christians, Jews, and Muslims in medieval Spain \u201cMedieval Devotion,\u201d moves away from the universities and cathedrals of Europe and investigates the lives of ordinary Christians trying to maintain their spiritual lives in an era almost 1000 years ago. The Church developed and popularized many devotional practices in this era, a number of which remain a part of Christianity today. Sacraments, saints, relics, pilgrimages, and the papacy are examined in this module, as all experienced an enormous growth in importance during the medieval era. Many of these features of Christianity became controversial, with Protestant reformers of the sixteenth century rejecting some of these devotional and ecclesiological features. \u201cLuther\u2019s Reformation,\u201d is the first of several modules to discuss the Reformation, and it does so by examining the life of the Reformation\u2019s most iconic figure, Martin Luther. More than any other person, Luther was responsible for the seismic shifts in sixteenth-century Christianity that left the Western Church permanently fractured. Why did Luther launch his Reformation? What were his initial aspirations, and how did these change? Through the biography of Luther we will learn about the controversies that led to the Reformation and the early impact of this religious movement. \u201cFragmenting Reformation,\u201d we will explore the Reformation further. After Luther set Europe ablaze, other reformers and rulers sought to impose their views onto Christianity. Soon\u2014and as Catholics had feared\u2014multiple forms of Protestantism emerged. Sixteenth-century Christians disagreed over what constituted proper ecclesiology, theology, and ritual practices, and soon the European religious landscape divided into different camps all insisting on different visions of Christianity. John Calvin became one of the most influential thinkers and organizers in this period, but even lesser known figures exerted enormous influence as Western Christendom experienced its most serious crisis.   In \u201cCatholic Reform,\u201d we will see how Catholicism transformed itself during the sixteenth century, an era usually characterized by the Protestant Reformation. In response to the Protestant challenge, Catholicism began to reform key aspects of its practices, yet Catholic leaders resolutely defended their theology against Luther\u2019s and Calvin\u2019s attacks. And Catholicism also experienced transformations that had begun long before Luther launched his reforming campaign in 1517. A debate still exists amongst historians regarding the origins of Catholicism\u2019s sixteenth-century reforms. Were these changes purely a response to the Protestant challenge? Or did Catholicism begin its early modern reforms long before Luther was ever born. This module explores these questions, along with the vibrant Catholic culture that emerged during the era of the Reformation. Our final module, \u201cJesuits and Mission,\u201d we will see how, at the same time that Western Christianity fractured and reinvented itself due to the Reformation, the faith also followed Europe\u2019s colonial paths and spread across the world. Catholic religious orders (including the newly founded Jesuit order) led the expansion of Christianity into non-European lands. Jesuits and other missionaries sought to inject Christianity into the societies they encountered, and to do so the Jesuits adapted to local cultural practices and added subtle features to Catholicism. For the first time, Christianity became a global religion.",

        "about": "What are the determinants of a happy and fulfilling life?This is surely one of life\u2019s biggest questions, and a question that has interested many of our ancestors. Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.\n\nHow valid are our theories?\n\nUntil recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nThis course, based on the award-winning class offered both at the Indian School of Business and at the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin, developed by Prof. Raj Raghunathan (aka \"Dr. Happy-smarts\") draws content from a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral decision theory to offer a tested and practical recipe for leading a life of happiness and fulfillment. \n\nAlthough not mandatory, reading Prof. Raj's forthcoming book, titled If you're so smart, why aren't you happy? can help you review and assimilate the material covered in this book at your leisure. \n\nFor Coursera learners alone, the hardcover version of the book is available for a deep discount of 50%, plus shipping and handling. You can order the hardcover for 50% off by writing to Aaron at: Aaron@800ceoread.com. Please mention that you are a student of the \"coursera happiness course\" in your email. \n\nThe course will feature guest appearances by several well-known thought leaders, including:\n      - Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational and, soon to be released, Irrationally Yours),\n      - Ed Diener (\u201cDr. Happiness\u201d),\n      - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (author of Flow),\n\nBy taking this course, you will discover the answers to questions such as:\n      - Why aren\u2019t the smart-and-the-successful as happy as they could\u2014or should\u2014be\n      - What are the \u201c7 Deadly Happiness Sins\u201d that even the smart and the successful commit?, and\n      - What are the \u201c7 Habits of the Highly Happy\u201d and how can you implement them in your life?\n\nBy the end of the course, I expect students who have been diligent with the lectures and exercises to not just gain a deeper understanding of the science of happiness, but to also be significantly happier.

For more information about IBM visit: www.ibm.com This module focuses on feedback loops and monitoring.  Feedback loops represent all the possible ways you can return to an earlier stage in the AI enterprise workflow. We initially discussed feedback loops in the first course of this specialization; however, here our focus is on unit testing.  We are also looking at business value, a very important consideration that often gets overlooked; is the model having as significant effect on business metrics as intended? It is important to be able to use log files that have been standardized across the team to answer questions about business value as well as performance monitoring.  You will have an opportunity to complete a case study on performance monitoring, where you will write unit tests for a logger and a logging API endpoint, test them, and write a suite of unit tests to validate if the logging is working correctly. This module will wrap up the formal learning in this course by completing hands on tutorials of Watson Openscale and Kubernetes.  IBM Watson OpensScale is a suite of services that allows you to track the performance of production AI and its impact on business goals, with actionable metrics, in a single console. Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform for managing, scheduling and automating the deployment of Docker containers. The containers we have developed as part of this course are essentially microservices meant to be deployed as cloud native applications. In this module you start part one (Data Investigation) of a three-part capstone project designed to pull everything you have learned together.  We have provided a brief review of what you should have learned thus far; however, you may want to review the first five courses prior to starting the project.  A major goal of this capstone is to emulate a real-world scenario, so we won\u2019t be providing notebooks to guide you as we have done with the previous case studies. In this module you will complete your capstone project and submit it for peer review. Part 2 of the Capstone project involves building models and selecting the best model to deploy. You will use time-series algorithms to predict future values based on previously observed values over time. In part 3 of the Capstone project, your focus will be creating a post-production analysis script that investigates the relationship between model performance and the business metrics aligned with the deployed model. After completing and submitting your capstone project, you will have access to the solution files for further review.

In this course we will use the process of design thinking, but it is the consistent application of a process in practice that is important, not the exact process itself. There are a number of reasons for choosing the design thinking process, but the most important is that it is being applied in a cross-disciplinary way\u2014that is outside of data science. Throughout this module you will learn or reinforce what you already know about identifying and articulating business opportunities. In this module you will learn the importance of applying a scientific thought process to the task of understanding the business use case. This process has many similarities to that of being an investigator. You will also generate a healthy respect for the need to pause, step back and think scientifically about the main processes in this stage. Cleaning, parsing, assembling and gut-checking data is among the most time-consuming tasks that a data scientist has to perform. The time spent on data cleaning can start at 60% and increase depending on data quality and the project requirements.

For more information about IBM visit: www.ibm.com Today data scientists have more tooling than ever before to create model-driven or algorithmic solutions, and it is important to know when to take the time to make code optimizations.  This week we spend a lot of time performing hands on activities.  We start this week by interacting with Apache Spark then progressing to a tutorial with Docker.  We\u2019ll wrap up the week working through a tutorial on Watson Machine Learning. This week is primarily focused on deploying models using Spark.  The rationale to move to Spark almost always has to do with scale, either at the level of model training or at the level of prediction. Although the resources available to build Spark applications are fewer than those for scikit-learn, Spark gives us the ability to build in an entirely scaleable environment.  We will also look at recommendation systems.  Most recommender systems today are able to leverage both explicit (e.g. numerical ratings) and implicit (e.g. likes, purchases, skipped, bookmarked) patterns in a ratings matrix.  The majority of modern recommender systems embrace either a collaborative filtering or a content-based approach. A number of other approaches and hybrids exist making some implemented systems difficult to categorize.  We wrap the week up with our hands-on case study on Model Deployment.

We will focus on the prolific and exciting overlap between socially engaged art and cultural practices generated by recent social movements around the world. Rather than assess the political efficacy of activities like mourning, listening, organizing, dancing, or partying, the lectures examine such cultural activities next to, and within, contemporary art practice. Included in the course are guest presentations by key artists, activists, and scholars, like: Rebecca Gomperts, Chido Govera, Gulf Labor, Hans Haacke, Sharon Hayes, Jolene Rickard, Gregory Sholette, Joshua Wong, and many more. Designed by artist and Duke professor, Pedro Lasch and co-taught by Creative Time artistic director, Nato Thompson, the course challenges learners to treat the MOOC itself as a social and artistic form. This happens mostly through the practical components, local project productions, global exchanges, and critical feedback.\n\nWhile no prior art making or activist experience is required, projects also offer challenging options for advanced learners.\n\nFor other course offerings or language versions in this series, just search 'ART of the MOOC' inside the Coursera course catalogue.

The university has a strong commitment to applying knowledge in service to society, both near its North Carolina campus and around the world.  This short module includes an overview of the course's structure, working process, global community, and overall guidelines. Make sure to read it right away and refer back to it whenever needed. This opening segment is dedicated to the prolific and exciting overlap between socially engaged art and cultural practices generated by recent social movements around the world. Environmentalism, AIDS activism, Queer movements, Zapatismo, immigrant rallies, alter-globalization, the World Social Forum, Occupy, the Hong Kong Umbrella Movement, museum boycotts, and democratic uprisings in the Middle East will be seen in dialogue with cultural producers who participate in these movements or are inspired by them. Rather than assess the political efficacy of such cultural activities, we will examine their place within contemporary art practices. Based on Listening, Organizing, Dancing, or Partying, each student\u2019s contribution will respond to a particular social movement of their choosing. The prompt, lecture and guest presentations will provide the foundation and inspiration for students\u2019 own experiments. These student experiments were originally peer reviewed projects in the ART of the MOOC series, but have now been made entirely optional and self-reviewed. If you want to do them, we recommend you chose one of the two options (one is more social, the other more individual) and complete the optional quiz after you are done. Your project submissions and the quiz are not graded, so they will not impact your performance in the course. Just as recent social movements have transformed contemporary art and culture, activists have relied on ideas developed in more specialized cultural circles, sometimes without knowing it. Starting with an exploration of the ways in which socially engaged public art has been included and excluded from particular narratives, theories, institutions, and events, we will use this lesson to follow social practices as they question conventional art and art history. As we do so, students will be invited to create projects that directly engage with Cultivating, Farming, Cooking, or Eating\u2014activities that are fundamentally social but traditionally seen to contradict serious artistic production. The prompt, lecture and guest presentations will provide the foundation and inspiration for students\u2019 own experiments.

This lesson will use the notion of \u2018embodied knowledges\u2019 to link activism and socially engaged art to performance art, gesture, and \u2018writing without words.\u2019 Recognizing that knowledge is inseparable from one\u2019s lived, physical, and social experience, \u2018embodied knowledges\u201d challenge the Western paradigms that separate information from matter, reason from affect, mind from the body, the worker from her labor, the individual from the collective.

Los estudiantes tendr\u00e1n que elegir una lecci\u00f3n para completar: El proyecto de m\u00e9todo social o el proyecto flashmob mundial. Por definici\u00f3n, el arte social es una tarea colectiva. Puede que pretenda a transformar las estructuras sociales y econom\u00edas m\u00e1s amplias. Tal vez, de una manera m\u00e1s modesta, puede que ofrezca algunas alternativas o sencillamente haga frente a retos inmediatos. La producci\u00f3n de un cuerpo colectivo involucrado, raro, o creativo puede ser su objetivo final. En esta lecci\u00f3n vamos a aprender c\u00f3mo artistas socialmente comprometidos han utilizado la apariencia o la forma verdadera de las organizaciones e instituciones como iglesias, corporaciones, bancos, oficinas gubernamentales, y otras entidades sociales como los propios medios de su trabajo.

        "about": "Students of this course may try their hand at their own public art interventions, or simply focus on learning from the theory of public practice and its recent history. Designed by artist and Duke professor, Pedro Lasch, and co-taught by Creative Time artistic director, Nato Thompson, this course presents public culture and art in their radically reinenvented contemporary forms. The lectures link major developments of recent decades to wider topics like spatial politics, everyday social structures, and experimental education. Also included are guest presentations from key thinkers and practitioners, like: Tania Bruguera, Claire Doherty, Tom Finkelpearl, Hans Haacke, Shannon Jackson, Suzanne Lacy, Rick Lowe, and many more. As the \u2018ART of the MOOC\u2019 title implies, learners and participants are encouraged to treat the MOOC itself as a public art medium. This happens mostly through the course\u2019s practical components, local project productions, global exchanges, and critical feedback.\n\nWhile no prior art making experience is required, projects also offer challenging options for advanced learners.\n\nFor other course offerings or language versions in this series, just search 'ART of the MOOC' in the Coursera catalog. Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish Duke University has about 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students and a world-class faculty helping to expand the frontiers of knowledge. The university has a strong commitment to applying knowledge in service to society, both near its North Carolina campus and around the world.  This short module provides an overview of the course's structure, working process, global community, and overall guidelines. Make sure to read it right away and refer back to it when needed. This lesson will lay out some basic definitions and examples of public practice and socially engaged art, especially as they relate to spatial politics. We will examine the critical role that such practices have had in relation to various forms of urbanism and social planning and consider the physical and symbolic mechanisms that separate the global and the local, the urban and the rural, the visible and the invisible, citizens and immigrants, settlers and refugees. The lecture and guest presentations will provide foundation and inspiration for students\u2019 own experiments with spatial politics. The prompt, lecture and guest presentations will provide the foundation and inspiration for students\u2019 own experiments. These student experiments were originally peer reviewed projects in the ART of the MOOC series, but have now been made entirely optional and self-reviewed. If you want to do them, we recommend you chose one of the two options (one is more social, the other more individual) and complete the optional quiz after you are done. Your project submissions and the quiz are not graded, so they will not impact your performance in the course. By definition, social art is a collective endeavor. It might seek to transform larger social structures and economies. Perhaps more modestly, it might offer some alternatives or simply confront immediate challenges. The production of an unusual, creative, or engaged collective body can be its final goal. In this lesson we will learn how socially engaged artists have used the guise or actual form of organizations and institutions such as churches, corporations, banks, government offices, and other social units as the very media of their work. This lesson\u2019s practical components will ask students to invent their own alternative social structures or fictional interventions. The prompt, lecture and guest presentations will provide the foundation and inspiration for students\u2019 own experiments.

Many socially engaged artists are invested in the communication of ideas through education or educational projects. From Freire and Boal to Judy Chicago and Miriam Shapiro\u2019s Womanhouse and the CalArts Feminist Art Program a brief review of experimental or radical pedagogy and its influence on art is hence the focus of this lesson. Using various technologies and social forms, some of these works set out to transform education from within. Others intentionally position themselves as self-organized platforms outside of institutions. Our focus will be on how the production of alternative communities of learning can challenge the hierarchies, professionalization, homogenization, and economy of current education systems. This week\u2019s practical components will invite students to rethink their relationship to education as they chose between small-scale socialization and massive collaboration.

This module will help you acquire critical reading skills so that you will develop as a self-critical writer. The module covers issues related to reading discipline-specific literature, which is indispensable from developing professional expertise in writing academic texts. The focus is on fundamental concepts of scientific writing, such as logical organization and argumentation. This module covers issues related to building academic vocabulary. The module clarifies word-formation processes, i.e., affixation, conversion, and compounding. The focus is on strategic language re-use and ways of dealing with new words. The module provides software tools for\u00a0extracting\u00a0frequently occurring\u00a0vocabulary specific\u00a0to an area of research. This module covers issues related to the pragmatics of academic English. The module presents an overview of the English verb system, including the most frequent tenses, three aspects, and two voices. The module highlights the use of correct punctuality, which is of immense help in meeting the goal of the writing process: to ensure clear communication of ideas. The module also explains the role of modality and register in academic writing. Another important issue discussed in the module is the use of parallel constructions for words, phrases, clauses, sentences, and paragraphs of an academic text. The final module looks beyond the sentence to the ways that grammar structures paragraphs and longer texts. The module covers issues related to the textuality of academic texts, i.e. cohesion, coherence, intentionality, acceptability, informativity, situationality, and intertextuality. In particular, the module focuses on lexical and grammatical cohesion. The module also discusses the concept of paragraphing and what the topic sentence and the statement of purpose mean for effective academic writing.",

Accessible webs, accessible web content, accessible transport, subtitling, audio description... the possiblities are endless.\nWhy is this course useful? \nTo make the venue and the production accessible to all citizens, and specially to persons with disablities. The course will go through the many accessible services you can offer, and how to implement them in your venue or your production. The final aim is to mainstream accessibility so all people have equal access to culture. Subtitles: English Subtitles: English The Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB) is a public university located in the metropolitan area of Barcelona. International in its outlook, it is fully consolidated within its local surroundings, and offers quality education in close association with research activity, the transfer of scientific, technological, cultural and educational knowledge, the promotion of its human potential and the responsible management of available resources.

The UAB has a total of over 3,500 teaching and research staff, over 2,000 administrative staff and over 40,000 students.  In this unit the participants learn about three essential concepts: First they will learn more about the different audiences at which accessibility may be aimed and the different types of access support they might need. Second, the concepts of \u2018inclusion\u2019 and \u2018accessibility\u2019 will be introduced and, more in particular, they will learn how these can be defined. Finally, this unit looks at legislation on inclusion and accessibility. More in particular, the participants will learn about the various types of international and European legislation on inclusion and accessibility. Unit 3 \u201cVenue Accessibility\u201d addresses barriers to access to cultural venues and how to remove them. Buildings such as theatres or opera houses or open-air venues used for festival purposes should be as accessible as possible. Based on a distinction between different venue types, this unit covers the accessibility chain, the FFZ principle, the accessibility of indoor and outdoor locations as well as temporary locations. Furthermore, it addresses forms of wayfinding, signs, maps and accessibility information as well as adaptations of the venue and assistance animals. Finally, it provides recommendations for assessing and improving venue accessibility.  This unit is about putting the knowledge about the access facilities presented in Unit 3a into practice, and covers the general and specific practical steps involved in implementing the access facilities in advance of the event, on the day of the event and after the event. In this unit you will learn about communicating and promoting accessibility, some may say \u201caccessibility PR\u201d. More in particular, you will learn to identify the relevant stakeholders and suggest strategies to involve them. You will learn what an accessibility policy for a cultural event or venue is and how to implement it. You will learn how to promote accessibility for a cultural event or venue, using both traditional and online media in an accessible way. In this unit, the participants learn about managing accessibility in a cultural venue or on a cultural event. They learn to plan and coordinate, they learn to communicate about accessibility and gather user feedback to be able to look into some aftercare. While managing these things they also think about solving conflicts and managing a team of coworkers.In the different learning materials of which the unit is composed, the participant is presented with charts to help managing the accessibility and with tips and tricks to do so via reading materials and video lessons.

        "about": "Accounting Analytics explores how financial statement data and non-financial metrics can be linked to financial performance. \u00a0In this course, taught by Wharton\u2019s acclaimed accounting professors, you\u2019ll learn how data is used to assess what drives financial performance and to forecast future financial scenarios. While many accounting and financial organizations deliver data, accounting analytics deploys that data to deliver insight, and this course will explore the many areas in which accounting data provides insight into other business areas including consumer behavior predictions, corporate strategy, risk management, optimization, and more. By the end of this course, you\u2019ll understand how financial data and non-financial data interact to forecast events, optimize operations, and determine strategy. This course has been designed to help you make better business decisions about the emerging roles of accounting analytics, so that you can apply what you\u2019ve learned to make your own business decisions and create strategy using financial data.\u00a0 Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, Korean, German, Russian, English, Spanish, Mongolian Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, Korean, German, Russian, English, Spanish, Mongolian The University of Pennsylvania (commonly referred to as Penn) is a private university, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. A member of the Ivy League, Penn is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, and considers itself to be the first university in the United States with both undergraduate and graduate studies.  The topic for this week is ratio analysis and forecasting. Since ratio analysis involves financial statement numbers, I\u2019ve included two optional videos that review financial statements and sources of financial data, in case you need a review. We will do a ratio analysis of a single company during the module. First, we\u2019ll examine the company's strategy and business model, and then we'll look at the DuPont analysis. Next, we\u2019ll analyze profitability and turnover ratios followed by an analysis of the liquidity ratios for the company. Once we've put together all the ratios, we can use them to forecast future financial statements. (If you\u2019re interested in learning more, I\u2019ve included another optional video, on valuation). By the end of this week, you\u2019ll be able to do a ratio analysis of a company to identify the sources of its competitive advantage (or red flags of potential trouble),  and then use that information to forecast its future financial statements.   This week we are going to examine \"earnings management\", which is the practice of trying to intentionally bias financial statements to look better than they really should look. Beginning with an overview of earnings management, we\u2019ll cover means, motive, and opportunity: how managers actually make their earnings look better, their incentives for manipulating earnings, and how they get away with it. Then, we will investigate red flags for two different forms of revenue manipulation. Manipulating earnings through aggressive revenue recognition practices is the most common reason that companies get in trouble with government regulators for their accounting practices. Next, we will discuss red flags for manipulating earnings through aggressive expense recognition practices, which is the second most common reason that companies get in trouble for their accounting practices. By the end of this module, you\u2019ll know how to spot earnings management and get a more accurate picture of earnings, so that you\u2019ll be able to catch some bad guys in finance reporting! This week, we\u2019ll use big data approaches to try to detect earnings management. Specifically, we're going to use prediction models to try to predict how the financial statements would look if there were no manipulation by the manager. First, we\u2019ll look at Discretionary Accruals Models, which try to model the non-cash portion of earnings or \"accruals,\" where managers are making estimates to calculate revenues or expenses. Next, we'll talk about Discretionary Expenditure Models, which try to model the cash portion of earnings. Then we'll look at Fraud Prediction Models, which try to directly predict what types of companies are likely to commit frauds. Finally, we\u2019ll explore something called Benford's Law, which examines the frequency with which certain numbers appear. If certain numbers appear more often than dictated by Benford's Law, it's an indication that the financial statements were potentially manipulated. These models represent the state of the art right now, and are what academics use to try to detect and predict earnings management. By the end of this module, you'll have a very strong tool kit that will help you try to detect financial statements that may have been manipulated by managers. Linking non-financial metrics to financial performance is one of the most important things we do as managers, and also one of the most difficult. We need to forecast future financial performance, but we have to take non-financial actions to influence it. And we must be able to accurately predict the ultimate impact on financial performance of improving non-financial dimensions. In this module, we\u2019ll examine how to uncover which non-financial performance measures predict financial results through asking fundamental questions, such as: of the hundreds of non-financial measures, which are the key drivers of financial success? How do you rank or weight non-financial measures which don\u2019t share a common denominator?  What performance targets are desirable? Finally, we\u2019ll look at some comprehensive examples of how companies have used accounting analytics to show how investments in non-financial dimensions pay off in the future, and finish with some important organizational issues that commonly arise using these models. By the end of this module, you\u2019ll know how predictive analytics can be used to determine what you should be measuring, how to weight very, very different performance measures when trying to analyze potential financial results, how to make trade-offs between short-term and long-term objectives, and how to set performance targets for optimal financial performance. This Specialization provides an introduction to big data analytics for all business professionals, including those with no prior analytics experience. You\u2019ll learn how data analysts describe, predict, and inform business decisions in the specific areas of marketing, human resources, finance, and operations, and you\u2019ll develop basic data literacy and an analytic mindset that will help you make strategic decisions based on data. In the final Capstone Project, you\u2019ll apply your skills to interpret a real-world data set and make appropriate business strategy recommendations.",

This module provides a brief introduction to financial statements and various common filings. These are the most important sources for obtaining information regarding a company's performance. Most strategies are indeed based on financial statements. After completing this module you will be able to get the important details from the balance sheets. The purpose of this module is to equip you with the skills required to identify accounting information required for building trading strategies. After completing this module you will be able to calculate the key financial ratios. In this series of videos,we will cover the basics of time value of money. This includes the idea of discounting and compounding of cash flows and why they needs to be done. We will see how to calculate the present and future values of various types of streams of cash flows like annuities and perpetuities. Finally, we will discuss the relationship between risk and discount rate and what type of risk drives the discount rate. In this series of videos, we will cover the various aspects related to deciding whether to accept or reject investment in a project.

Any organization \u2013 no matter how large or small \u2013 is extremely complex. It is made up of processes, systems, products, and \u2013 perhaps most important \u2013 people. Why are people most important? Because they are the ones making decisions, guiding the firm towards success. Wondering what these decisions are and how they\u2019re made? Join in on Module 1!  Every decision \u2013 no matter how big or small \u2013 comes down to trading off benefits versus costs. Sounds simple, right? Potential benefits are often easy to envision, and even fun to think about. Costs \u2013 a bit less fun \u2013 but isn\u2019t it just the price you pay? Not quite. As you\u2019ll see in Module 2, nothing is as simple as it seems! Making decisions can be quite daunting. You need to be able to make predictions about the consequences of your actions so that you can make the best decision. Where do you start? Crystal balls are in short supply. So, how about the next best thing? Jump into Module 3 to learn about cost-volume-profit analysis!   Owners, managers, and employees often run into two obstacles when making decisions: (1) not enough of the information they need, and (2) too much of the information they don\u2019t need. Surprisingly, the second problem is often harder to overcome than the first, especially in today\u2019s information-rich environment. How do accountants help managers solve this problem? Jump into Module 4 to find out! Accounting is the \u201clanguage of business.\u201d Being able to understand this language allows individuals both inside and outside of an organization to join the \u201cconversation\u201d about how the organization is performing and how it can improve future performance. Financial accounting focuses on the reports that managers generate to provide interested external parties a summary of the firm\u2019s financial position and operations. Managerial accounting focuses on the information and the analytical tools and techniques that help managers and employees make the right business decisions.In this Specialization, you will learn the fundamentals of both of these purposes of accounting. More specifically, you will understand the financial statements that managers create, and be able to interpret and analyze these statements to assess the financial position of the organization. You will also identify and understand the nature, purpose, and importance of different types of decision-useful accounting information, and use analytical tools and techniques to use this information to make business decisions. Via the capstone, you will apply these fundamentals via the lens of a new business, creating a business plan, forecasts and budgets, and anticipated information needs for decisions made by you as owner and manager, your employees, and external parties such as future shareholders, creditors, and other constituents.",

        "about": "Through this course, you will start by addressing the two \u201cbig questions\u201d of accounting: \u201cWhat do I have?\u201d and \u201cHow did I do over time?\u201d You will see how the two key financial statements \u2013 the balance sheet and the income statement - are designed to answer these questions and then move on to consider how individual transactions aggregate to make up these financial statements. After developing a broad understanding of accounting and financial statements, you will begin to develop a more nuanced understanding of individual components of doing business, such as making a sale or building inventory.  By considering many of the more common actions of a company, you will build your understanding of accounting, and explore these concepts by applying them across various types of transactions. Once you understand these individual concepts better, you will be ready to return to the overall financial statements and use them as informational tools, including building ratios.You can do this course standalone or to qualify for the residential component of the Finance for Strategic Decision-Making Executive Education program.  For more information, see the FAQ below. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish The mission of the University of Michigan is to serve the people of Michigan and the world through preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future. Every organized society needs information about its activities and accomplishments.  Accounting was created to fulfill this need.  In this module we will explore how accounting was designed to meet the needs of decision makers and what this means to you as a user of accounting information.  We will discuss the concept behind accrual accounting including introducing the two primary accrual accounting financial statements - the balance sheet and income statement.  This module will discuss the purpose and goal of those financial statements, but we will save your experience in creating those statements until module two.  In lesson two of this module, we will explore some basic bookkeeping tools that will get you ready to create a set of financial statements.  The material in this module is likely to take less than a week, but we will make up for it in module two. In this module we will create a set of accrual accounting financial statements.  We will use that experience to walk you through the accounting cycle - which is the process by which accounting captures and aggregates all of the transactions in the period into a set of financial statements.  We will examine each step in the accounting cycle using a comprehensive example of a start up wholesale book retailer.  You will learn how the steps combine to create the statements.  In addition to the comprehensive example we will do together, there will be plenty of chances to practice each step yourself.  This module ends with a chance for you to build your own set of financial statements for a start up company.  Fair warning: in my opinion this is the least exciting material covered in any accounting class (including this one).  It is the basic bookkeeping process, not the interesting part of building an understanding of the business.  But just as you need to learn basic addition and subtraction before you can master the math to design a beautiful building, you also need to learn basic bookkeeping as a foundation for the more interesting accounting.     In the last module we took an overview perspective to get a sense of the structure of financial statements.  For the next three modules we are going to delve into the details of specific items on the accrual financial statements.  We will work through the most common items on the balance sheet and income statement to develop an understanding of those items.  While we will consider specific items, we will also be building a thought process that we can apply to any future accounting items - even if they are topics that we do not cover in this course.  That will allow you to confidently use accounting for years to come, regardless of changes in items or in the specific accounting rules.There are two lessons in this module.  The first will cover revenue and the related balance sheet item of accounts receivable.  The second lesson will cover costs of goods sold and inventory.  We will cover the conceptual economics of each, discuss the current accounting rules and end with a video that applies our bookkeeping tools.  The readings for each lesson provide more details. As firms operate, they often use long-lived assets to execute their business models.  Some of these assets are tangible, such as factories or computers.  Others are intangible, such as trademarks and brands.  In either case, managers face the issue of determining how much of these items were used in each period as well as the related question of how much remains.  In this module, we will examine the economics of such transactions as well how accountants reflect them on financial statements.  This module will also cover the most nebulous of intangible assets - goodwill. In the last two modules we have been exploring assets and their impact on both the balance sheet and income statement.  In this module we will turn to discussing the other two components of the balance sheet: liabilities and owners equity.As firms operate, they make promise to deliver value to other entities.  Accountants call these promises liabilities.  You have already seen some liabilities as we discussed assets - after all, you get many assets by promising to give up future value.  We will review those liabilities here as well as introducing a few new ones.  Firms also have owners.  Those owners sometimes directly provide capital and other times let managers retain capital generated by firm operations.  Combined, those two sources of capital represent owners equity.  We will discuss interaction with owners and how they impact our firms economic situation.  We will also discuss how the accounting statements reflect these interactions. We have been spending our time developing the concepts of accrual accounting.  We started with the big picture, learned how to use bookkeeping to construct accrual statements and then spent the last three modules deep diving into various accrual accounting topics that help to create a useful set of financial statements.  Throughout that time we have focused on capturing economics, not just cash flow.  Of course, many of you still want to know about cash (so do I - it is important).  But I have put off the cash flow statement for two reasons.  First, I wanted you to really give accrual accounting a chance.  If we mix cash in from the beginning, most students seem to drift back to cash every time things get a little complicated.  But we have demonstrated that often leads to misinformed choices.  Second, the cash flow statement effectively requires you to \"undo\" accrual accounting.  That means you have to know accrual accounting pretty well to do a cash flow statement.\nI am going to be honest (I have all along, after all).  The cash flow statement is tough.  It seems like it should be really straight forward.  Parts of it are.  But a few choices were made when the cash flow statement rules were set.  The choices make sense (well, somewhat), but they also make cash flow statements hard.  We will break it down into pieces to make it approachable, but it is my experience that people need to see this multiple times.  Lucky for you, the videos can be watched as often as you want. \nIn this module I will systematically walk you through how cash flow statements are constructed.  We  will start with a cash T account and build statements from there.  Our goal is to build an understanding of what information you can take from a cash flow statement.  We are going to spend an entire week just on the cash flow statement.  At the end of that week, I will expect you can understand an overall statement, but I will not expect you to be able to build one from scratch.  Finally, I want to point out that this module is an inflection point in the course.  We started looking at the idea of financial statements and creating broad statements in modules one and two.  In modules three through five we began to look at the financial statements one item at a time.  With this module we are moving back to the overall statement level, which is the perspective we will also take next module (which will be our last). We have covered a lot of ground.  You now are familiar with financial statements and the underlying transactions that create them.  Our goal is to help you use accounting to make decisions and you have surely gotten much better at that.  Now we get the big payoff - we learn how to build ratios to provide insights regarding the decisions we are making (maybe even to help us decide what types of decisions we should consider).  We have seen a few ratios as we went through the course, but in this module we are going to discuss how to go about making your own ratios related to whatever question you want to answer.  I think you will be surprised to find how easy it is now that you understand accounting.  In fact, it is so easy that it will be just a couple of short lessons.  Along with those short lessons, the rest of the week can be used to prepare for and take the final comprehensive exam.  It will go back over material from each module to assure that you can pull it all together.",

        "about": "Are you concerned about climate change? Would you like to learn how to address and respond to this challenge? If so, this course is for you.  Act on Climate: Steps to Individual, Community, and Political Action is intended to help learners understand, address and respond to climate change as individuals and in partnership with their communities and political leaders. The course focuses on how to translate learning into action on climate change in the areas of food, energy, transportation and the built environment (cities). This course was co-developed and taught by Michaela Zint, Professor of Environmental Education and Communication, and University of Michigan Students. A range of academic climate change experts and professional leaders are featured.\n\nAs a result of completing this course, you will be able to:\n\n1) Identify individual, community, and political actions you can engage in to effectively address and respond to climate change.\n\n2) Describe how insights from the social sciences can be employed to create change at the individual, community, and political levels.\n\n3) Feel empowered to continue to influence how you, your community, and political leaders address and respond to climate change.\n\nUse #UMichActonClimate on social media to share what you're doing and connect with other learners. Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish The mission of the University of Michigan is to serve the people of Michigan and the world through preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future. As part of this introductory lesson, we will help you explore your motivations for taking this course, briefly introduce you to the current state of climate science and policy, and prepare you for taking actions on climate change throughout the course.  Food is part of our everyday lives. From breakfast to dinner, we make choices that affect the planet. This week, you will hear from Chris about his journey toward vegetarianism, and you will learn from Dr. Sara Soderstrom about social movement theory and food businesses in Detroit, as well as actions that you can take to make food choices that can mitigate climate change. We use energy in almost everything we do, but there are also many ways we can reduce emissions from our energy consumption. This week, you will hear from Benjamin about saving energy in cold winters and from Dr. Kaitlin Raimi about the theory of environmental peer persuasion. You will also learn several actions you can take to reduce energy consumption in your home, on your campus, and in your community.  Transportation is part of everyday life. This week, you will hear from Stephanie about the collective impact of personal transportation decisions and from Brandon Schoettle about how driving decisions impact greenhouse gas emissions. You will also examine popular ride-hailing services, as well as actions that you can take to make transportation choices that can mitigate climate change, and ultimately you will learn to support a more resilient transportation system. There is a complex relationship between our lives and the built infrastructure with which we interact on a daily basis. This week, you will learn about one theory of urban design - \u201cNew Urbanism\u201d - and use it as a way to explore these relationships and how you can reimagine the built environment as a means to act on climate change. You will also learn about how one city used deliberative democracy to transform their built environment and move toward carbon neutrality. Together, the content will assist you in identifying how the built environment can be transformed to address the effects of climate change.  This week, you will apply ideas you learned in this course, learn about another relevant social change theory, and develop your own Personal Climate Action Plan. As part of this plan you will identify individual and community-related actions that you can take to mitigate the impact of increased greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change after completing this course. You have now learned about a variety of theories of social change and tried a range of mitigation and adaptation actions. We hope that this will not be the end! During this concluding week, we will provide you with resources to continue to engage in climate actions, including: making new practices \u201cstick,\u201d how to work with your community, and why you might even consider making a bigger commitment, like running for political office.

        "about": "Sports have become an ever-present reflection of American culture, and an important symbol of the divisions and alliances in our society. Sports and political change walk hand in hand in America. The way that athletes and institutions deal with questions of race, economic hardship, nationalism, and political ties have become central to the way that we understand ourselves and our society. And yet, there are those who would prefer their sports free of controversy and opinion. Dedicated athletes, coaches, and media personalities have pushed back against this refrain, demanding to be seen not just as entertainers but as fully formed humans with political opinions and experiences. Their struggles against injustice have changed the face of America and kicked off a reckoning within modern-day sports. How does context inform the shape and outcome of protests? What is it about sports that provides space \u2014 or doesn't \u2014 for political statements? Why do some of us expect athletes to be activists, when others would rather they \"shut up and dribble\"? We'll explore all of these questions and more in this class. \n\nYour professor will be NBA All-Star and TNT Sports journalist and commentator Chris Webber, who leads interviews with iconic activists, including John Carlos and Jemele Hill as they wrestle with the meanings and outcomes of their activism. You'll read and watch primary source documents about acts of protest, and academic and journalistic work that reckons with the legacies of those acts. By the end of the course, you'll have a better understanding of historical and contemporary protest moments, and be able to create and apply new ways of thinking about the activism within the world of sports in history and today. Subtitles: English Subtitles: English With expertise in leadership, civil rights, and social justice unique in the world, Morehouse College is committed to helping the nation address inequities and use innovation to solve global challenges. Morehouse is the nation\u2019s top producer of Black men who go on to receive doctorates, the top producer of Rhodes Scholars among HBCUs, and is among U.S. institutions which produced the most Fulbright Scholars in 2019-2020. Morehouse is the only historically Black college dedicated to educating men, with trailblazing alumni including Nobel laureate Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Academy Award-winner Spike Lee, and U.S. Senator Raphael Warnock. The history of activism and sports stretches to the beginnings of athletics in America, but perhaps the most iconic moment of protest was at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. In this module, you'll learn about the men who took a stand there, the historical context of the act, and how their country and the world responded.  Not all acts of protest are committed by people who consider themselves activists. In this module, you'll learn about NBA Hall of Fame honoree Spencer Haywood. At 19 he was the youngest American to win a gold medal at the 1968 Olympics. At 21, he brought a lawsuit against the NBA that would forever change the game. What role do journalists play in activism? Is it better to use an existing platform, or to build their own? In this module you'll witness the evolution of Jemele Hill from ESPN personality to outspoken activist.  This module spans the career of Dr. Harry Edwards. As a sociologist and academic, Dr. Edwards created the field of sports sociology. As an activist, he has supported and counseled athletes in their acts of protest, from the Olympic Project for Human Rights to Colin Kaepernick's protest of the National Anthem. ",

This course examines these tensions and how transformational, authentic and inclusive leadership styles offer an alternative to the more autocratic, job-centred and controlling leadership styles of the past. You\u2019ll learn how the digital revolution, along with an increased focus on projects and teamwork, has dramatically altered the perception of leadership in a way that now demands all organisational members take on some form of self-leadership. And you\u2019ll learn how this change is causing tensions between traditional leaders and the contemporary practices vital to maintain agility in today\u2019s ultra-competitive marketplace. This learning will be complemented by structured activities such as video lectures, quizzes, discussion prompts and written assessments.

Since our foundation 54 years ago, we have aspired to be a different type of university: one focused on fostering collaboration between students, academics, industry and society. Welcome to your first week in the Adapt your leadership style course. This week you will take a look at the material that will be covered in this course, what you can expect to learn, and the questions that you explore. This week presents you with a number of models and tools to help you develop a helicopter view of the challenges of contemporary leadership and become confident in your ability to critically analyze the wide range of ideas and theories you will encounter. This week you will examine the concept of leadership as something possessed by an individual, looking at personality traits, profiles, attitudes and behaviors associated with the practice of leadership. Welcome to the second week in the Adapt your Leadership Style course. This week you will deepen your understanding of leadership as a set of behaviours or traits possessed or displayed by an individual. In doing so, you will see how the relatively self-enclosed leadership concepts presented in the first week have increased in sophistication and complexity via notions of leadership styles and decision-making variables. The models examining this range from the academically pure, but perhaps unrealistic in practice, contingency models of leadership, to the highly pragmatic interpretations of leadership action and style found in the politics and power struggles of organisational life.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Welcome to the third week in the Adapt your Leadership Style course. This week you will leave the ideas of individual leadership traits, behaviors, and styles behind and focus on the theories and practices of team leadership. Building from the baseline skills of communication, coaching and conflict resolution, you will then examine the complex interrelationships in teams through concepts of in-group and out-group behavior, and leader-follower roles and interactions. Finally, you will examine how teamwork itself is becoming complex and varied, with many people charged with leading virtual teams or displaying informal leadership qualities in self-managed teams. Welcome to the fourth week in the Adapt your Leadership Style course. Having covered individual leadership theories and the demands of leading teams, it is now time for the big league \u2013 how to lead an organization. Starting with an examination of the shift from transactional to transformational leadership, this week illustrates why the challenge of leading a contemporary organisation can be so mystifying. Ranging from the way in which leaders must generate emotional responses in their followers through charisma, vision and culture, to the complex challenge of leading diverse groups of people, this week concludes with the concept of authentic leadership \u2013 which questions the very validity of all the theories that precede it.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Welcome to the fifth week in the Adapt your Leadership Style course. This week you will examine two established, but somewhat alternative, concepts of leadership that examine how leaders have to learn to deal with ambiguity in order to lead effectively. You will first explore the idea that leaders go through developmental stages, which are formed through progressively more sophisticated and multi-level perspectives and practices. Following that, you will examine how leadership is never easy but risky and necessarily adaptive, injecting discomforting ambiguity into seemingly obvious situations at its highest level. Finally, you will look at how contemporary ideas about organisational conditions might be pushing such perspectives on leadership increasingly into the mainstream spotlight.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Welcome to the final week in the Adapt your Leadership Style course. This week you will leave mainstream theory behind and examine some radical and pragmatic perspectives on leadership. The radical perspective will examine how leadership and followership are contested perspectives that have a darker side that can be used to \u201clegitimize\u201d some unenlightened behaviours. Taking these claims seriously, you will see how some pragmatic ideas on leadership have revealed the degree to which \u201cbad\u201d or \u201ctoxic\u201d leadership has proliferated, how leadership development seems to struggle to solve this challenge, and the behaviors and misbehaviors associated with this problem. Finally, you will examine some ideas proposed by populist leadership gurus and look at the ways in which leadership might be conceptualized in the future.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Become an adaptable leader, ready to face the challenges of the disrupted workplace. This Specialization will equip you with the skills to lead and navigate the ever-changing global environment we now work in.

Adaptability is what allows people and businesses to solve problems, overcome challenges and move back from the edge of attrition to the more stable ground of relevance. Adaptability is everything. \u2014 Jeff Boss, ForbesAdaptability refers to your ability change your actions, course, or approach in order to suit different conditions or environments. Adaptability implies a sense of personal choice, of purposefully navigating\u2014rather than being driven by\u2014changing circumstances. \n\nResilience is the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties. Resilience gives you the ability to bounce forward with new insights and learning you can carry into the future. \n\nBoth adaptability and resilience include the ability to assess an evolving situation from multiple perspectives, to shift thinking and viewpoint, and to choose the best response. Adaptable people flourish amidst chaos while inflexible people flounder. Adapters find openings in situations where others only see closure. This 4-module course will give you knowledge and tools to become more adaptable and resilient in your workplace and in your life.

Just one of the four experiments generates thousands gigabytes per second. The intensity of data flow is only going to be increased over the time. So the data processing techniques have to be quite sophisticated and unique. In this course we\u2019ll introduce students into the main concepts of the Physics behind those data flow so the main puzzles of the Universe Physicists are seeking answers for will be much more transparent. Of course we will scrutinize the major stages of the data processing pipelines, and focus on the role of the Machine Learning techniques for such tasks as track pattern recognition, particle identification, online real-time processing (triggers) and search for very rare decays. The assignments of this course will give you opportunity to apply your skills in the search for the New Physics using advanced data analysis techniques.

Also, we'll describe main stages of data collection and analysis that happens at LHC experiment. Each step is associated with specific machine learning challenges and some of which we are going to cover later. The final part of the module describes a very high-level example of data analysis that shows how simple data analysis techniques can be used for discovery of an elementary particle. This module is about detectors in high energy physics. It describes several detector designs, different detector systems, how they work and what particle parameters they measure. Several cases in high energy physics where machine learning can be successfully applied are demonstrated. In this module, we explain how new physics search can be mediated through a search for rare processes. We describe the main steps physicists have to follow to find rare decay. At first search for such phenomena may look like a perfect task for machine learning algorithms. However, there are several constraints that one have to keep in mind during training and application of a classifier. We start this module with explanation what Dark Matter phenomenon is about and what are the general strategies for Dark Matter search. Then we boil down the topic towards one of the CERN proposed experiments - SHiP. Given the design of the experiment, we consider the signatures that Dark Matter particles may produce. Of course, Machine Learning algorithms can be applied to discriminate such signatures from the background. We'll see how clustering algorithms can improve the signal visibility even further. This module covers several cases of detector design optimization in high energy physics experiments using Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes. This specialization gives an introduction to deep learning, reinforcement learning, natural language understanding, computer vision and Bayesian methods. Top Kaggle machine learning practitioners and CERN scientists will share their experience of solving real-world problems and help you to fill the gaps between theory and practice. Upon completion of 7 courses you will be able to apply modern machine learning methods in enterprise and understand the caveats of real-world data and settings.",

These are very important for making your sentences interesting and more complex. In this course, you'll learn the rules for using adjectives and adjective clauses correctly. In the first module, you will review what adjectives are and how to use them correctly in English. Then you'll learn about adjective phrases. You'll have plenty of chances to practice this material. In this module, you will learn about adjective clauses. Like adjectives and adjective phrases, adjective clauses describe or modify nouns. You will learn what an adjective clause looks like and how to use them correctly to make your sentences more complex. Now, you'll learn about some other common types of adjective clauses. Keep in mind what you already know as it will help you learn these new structures. In this last module, you will learn a different way to use adjective clauses. It is different but very common and, therefore, important. This specialization covers common topics in intermediate grammar, such as perfect verb tenses and adjective clauses. It will also cover \"tricky English\" grammar topics that learners of English often find frustrating.

Advanced algorithms build upon basic ones and use new ideas. We will start with networks flows which are used in more typical applications such as optimal matchings, finding disjoint paths and flight scheduling as well as more surprising ones like image segmentation in computer vision. We then proceed to linear programming with applications in optimizing budget allocation, portfolio optimization, finding the cheapest diet satisfying all requirements and many others. Next we discuss inherently hard problems for which no exact good solutions are known (and not likely to be found) and how to solve them in practice. We finish with a soft introduction to streaming algorithms that are heavily used in Big Data processing.

You can see it when shipping goods across highways and routing packets across the internet. In this unit, we will discuss the mathematical underpinnings of network flows and some important flow algorithms. We will also give some surprising examples on seemingly unrelated problems that can be solved with our knowledge of network flows. Linear programming is a very powerful algorithmic tool. Essentially, a linear programming problem asks you to optimize a linear function of real variables constrained by some system of linear inequalities. This is an extremely versatile framework that immediately generalizes flow problems, but can also be used to discuss a wide variety of other problems from optimizing production procedures to finding the cheapest way to attain a healthy diet. Surprisingly, this very general framework admits efficient algorithms. In this unit, we will discuss some of the importance of linear programming problems along with some of the tools used to solve them. Although many of the algorithms you've learned so far are applied in practice a lot, it turns out that the world is dominated by real-world problems without a known provably efficient algorithm. Many of these problems can be reduced to one of the classical problems called NP-complete problems which either cannot be solved by a polynomial algorithm or solving any one of them would win you a million dollars (see Millenium Prize Problems) and eternal worldwide fame for solving the main problem of computer science called P vs NP. It's good to know this before trying to solve a problem before the tomorrow's deadline :) Although these problems are very unlikely to be solvable efficiently in the nearest future, people always come up with various workarounds. In this module you will study the classical NP-complete problems and the reductions between them. You will also practice solving large instances of some of these problems despite their hardness using very efficient specialized software based on tons of research in the area of NP-complete problems. After the previous module you might be sad: you've just went through 5 courses in Algorithms only to learn that they are not suitable for most real-world problems. However, don't give up yet! People are creative, and they need to solve these problems anyway, so in practice there are often ways to cope with an NP-complete problem at hand. We first show that some special cases on NP-complete problems can, in fact, be solved in polynomial time. We then consider exact algorithms that find a solution much faster than the brute force algorithm. We conclude with approximation algorithms that work in polynomial time and find a solution that is close to being optimal.  In most previous lectures we were interested in designing algorithms with fast (e.g. small polynomial) runtime, and assumed that the algorithm has random access to its input, which is loaded into memory. In many modern applications in big data analysis, however, the input is so large that it cannot be stored in memory. Instead,  the input is presented as a stream of updates, which the algorithm scans while maintaining a small summary of the stream seen so far. This is precisely the setting of the streaming model of computation, which we study in this lecture. The streaming model is well-suited for designing and reasoning about small space algorithms. It has received a lot of attention in the literature, and several powerful algorithmic primitives for computing basic stream statistics in this model have been designed, several of them impacting the practice of big data analysis. In this lecture we will see one such algorithm (CountSketch), a small space algorithm for finding the top k most frequent items in a data stream. This specialization is a mix of theory and practice: you will learn algorithmic techniques for solving various computational problems and will implement about 100 algorithmic coding problems in a programming language of your choice. No other online course in Algorithms even comes close to offering you a wealth of programming challenges that you may face at your next job interview. To prepare you, we invested over 3000 hours into designing our challenges as an alternative to multiple choice questions that you usually find in MOOCs. Sorry, we do not believe in multiple choice questions when it comes to learning algorithms...or anything else in computer science! For each algorithm you develop and implement, we designed multiple tests to check its correctness and running time \u2014 you will have to debug your programs without even knowing what these tests are! It may sound difficult, but we believe it is the only way to truly understand how the algorithms work and to master the art of programming. The specialization contains two real-world projects: Big Networks and Genome Assembly. You will analyze both road networks and social networks and will learn how to compute the shortest route between New York and San Francisco (1000 times faster than the standard shortest path algorithms!) Afterwards, you will learn how to assemble genomes from millions of short fragments of DNA and how assembly algorithms fuel recent developments in personalized medicine.",

As we discussed in this specialization, data preprocessing and cleanup is often the first step in data analytics projects. Needless to say, this step is crucial for the success of this project.  We've selected a few videos from Courses 2 and 4 for you to review before completing this week's assignments. Dealing With Missing Values and Dealing with Outliers videos will remind you how to perform preliminary data cleanups.  The last part of the assignments ask you to construct data visualizations. You may find the ideas discussed in What is Good Data Visualization? and Graphical Excellence useful.  This week you will perform some predictive analytics tasks, including classifying loans and predicting losses from defaulted loans. You will try a variety of tools and techniques this week, as the predictive accuracy of different tools can vary quite a bit. It is rarely the case that the default model produced by ASP is the best model possible. Therefore, it is important for you to tune the different models in order to improve the performance.This week\u2019s assignments require you to build predictive models for both classification and regression tasks. <p> Before working on the assignments, you may review a few videos to remind yourself several important concepts, such as cross validation. These concepts are discussed in the videos  Cross Validation and Confusion Matrix and Assessing Predictive Accuracy Using Cross-Validation. You may also find a refresher on XLMiner useful. The videos Building Logistic Regression Models using XLMiner  and How to Build a Model using XLMiner discuss how to build logistic regression and linear regression models. Depending on your needs, you may also go back to the videos that discuss how to build trees and neural networks. </p> This week we turn our attention to prescriptive analytics, where you will provide some concrete suggestions on how to allocate investment funds using analytics tools, including clustering and simulation-based optimization. You will see that allocating funds wisely is crucial for the financial return of the investment portfolio. <p>The relevant videos for this week are from Course 3: Week 1: Cluster analysis with XLMiner, Week 2: Adding uncertainty to spreadsheet model, Week 2: Defining output variables and analyzing results. </p> You have done a lot so far! In this last week, you will present to your analytics results to your clients. Since you have many results in your project, it is important for you to judiciously choose what to include in your presentation. Several videos in Course 4 offer some guidelines on communicating analytics results. This assignment will give you an opportunity to apply the skills you learned there. Good luck!

Companies that were leaders in their time but failed to adapt to change. In this module, we'll explore the impact of disruptive innovations and how companies can navigate these changes, evolve over time, and avoid the pitfalls of the competitive life cycle. By the end of this  module, you will be able to complete a competitive life cycle analysis. Let's get started. Welcome! Industry and firm globalization has taken off in the past few decades. Firms can realize great gains by moving into foreign markets, but they only do so if they act strategically. In this module, we'll discuss the rise of globalization and explore two primary strategic questions: Where to compete and how to enter that market.  We'll consider the pros and cons of strategic options for entering foreign markets. By the end of this module, you'll be able to complete an internationalization analysis. Corporate strategy is often a question of diversification. How can firms leverage their current position across markets to build profits? In this module, we'll discuss firm scope and the financial, operational, and strategic reasons to expand and diversify. We'll explore the theory of the firm--or why firms exist and how this relates to their scope. By the end of this module, you'll be able to develop a diversification matrix.  How can a firm's values add value to the firm? Stakeholder management is a way of thinking about ethical considerations impacting an organization's strategy. In this module, we'll discuss how effective business strategy considers the impact of a firm's decisions and actions on various stakeholders, both primary and secondary, and uses that knowledge to guide strategic actions. By the end of this module, you'll be able to complete a stakeholder analysis.  This Specialization covers both the dynamics and the global aspects of strategic management.

        "about": "A chemistry course to cover selected topics covered in advanced high school chemistry courses, correlating to the standard topics as established by the American Chemical Society.Prerequisites: Students should have a background in basic chemistry including nomenclature, reactions, stoichiometry, molarity and thermochemistry. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish The University of Kentucky is the Commonwealth\u2019s flagship, land-grant institution of higher learning. With more than 30,000 students and 16 academic colleges and a graduate school, it is one of only eight universities in America with the full range of professional, medical and liberal arts programs on one contiguous campus. The study of chemical kinetics is the study of change over time. It answers questions like:How fast are reactants consumed?\nHow fast are products formed?\nThis unit is dedicated to the exploration of how these questions are answered. We will look at the experimental evidence of how concentration affects these rates.\n\nWe will also examine what occurs on the molecular level, especially with respect to the motion of molecules, that affects rates of reactions. This unit introduces the concept of chemical equilibrium and how it applies to many chemical reactions. The quantitative aspects of equilibrium are explored thoroughly through discussions of the law of mass action as well as the relationship between equilibrium constants with respect to concentrations and pressures of substances. Much of the discussion explores how to solve problems to find either the value of the equilibrium constant or the concentrations of substances at equilibrium. ICE (initial-change-equilibrium) tables are introduced as a problem-solving tool and multiple examples of their use are included.From a qualitative standpoint, Le Ch\u00e2telier\u2019s principle is used to explain how various factors affect the equilibrium constant of a reaction along with the concentrations of all species. The concept of equilibrium is applied to acid and base solutions. To begin, the idea of weak acids and bases is explored along with the equilibrium constants associated with their ionization in water and how the value of the equilibrium constant is associated with the strength of the acid or base. The autoionization of water is discussed and how temperature affects this process. A variety of problem types are covered including calculations of pH, pOH, [OH-], and [H+] for both strong and weak acids and bases.\n\nAqueous salt solutions are classified as acids and bases and the multi-step ionization of polyprotic acids is discussed. Finally, the concept of Lewis acids and bases is discussed and demonstrated through examples. This unit continues and expands on the theme of equlibria. You will examine buffers, acid/base titrations and the equilibria of insoluble salts. The overarching theme of thermodynamics is the prediction of whether a reaction will occur spontaneously under a certain set of conditions. Entropy and Free Energy are defined and utilized for this purpose.",

We will find out how firms can increase their profits by pursuing suitable price discrimination and product differentiation strategies.\n \nWe will look at examples of what is acceptable behavior under the premises of EU competition and US antitrust policies and discover exciting ways of how companies can increase their returns by strategically making use of network effects and economies of size. We will further intensify our newly acquired knowledge about network effects and discuss strategies that are explicitly tailored to network markets.\n \nWe will analyze the workings of mergers and acquisitions and, moreover, support you in considering alternative strategies that can help companies grow organically. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Chinese (Simplified), Italian, Portuguese (Brazilian), Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Chinese (Simplified), Italian, Portuguese (Brazilian), Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish As one of Europe's leading research universities, LMU Munich is committed to the highest international standards of excellence in research and teaching. Building on its 500-year-tradition of scholarship, LMU covers a broad spectrum of disciplines, ranging from the humanities and cultural studies through law, economics and social studies to medicine and the sciences. In this module we will look at strategies that can help us maintain our customer base. For this, we will take an analytical approach that helps us understand the point at which our customers will switch to a competitors and the amount of money a competitor is willing to spend to acquire our customers. Based on this understanding, we will derive applicable strategies that can help us lock in our customers strategically. We will do this by keeping in mind that also customers may apply their own strategies to avoid lock in and further, that our competitors will seek to apply strategies in the pursuit of making our customers theirs. We will look at the benefits of price discrimination as a strategic tool that can help us to skim off our customer\u2019s willingness to pay and increase our utility accordingly. We are then going to learn the different ways of aligning a price discrimination strategy with successful product design and the three different ways in which a price discrimination strategy can be formulated. In this module we will demonstrate that if you want to operate a business you have to keep in mind that there are some powerful external entities, so-called competition authorities, that highly value and safeguard competition. While this supports and opens up opportunities for your business if it is new or relatively small and would otherwise simply be crushed by larger incumbent firms \u2013 it can also put you in danger if you have already achieved a certain size, have acquired more market power are already in a rather powerful position. In this module, we are going to discover two very important new concepts with which you can increase your business\u2019s returns:  Network effects and boundaries of the firm. We will find that considering these two concepts in formulating our business strategy can help us improve our strategy\u2019s effectiveness and eventually increase our returns. We will build upon our knowledge from module 4 and look into competition in network markets, adoption rates and the advantage of critical mass. Following from this, we will learn why this is essential for reaching the point of critical mass. We will moreover discuss ways in which companies can raise the attention of potential consumers and reduce their perceived risk. We will look at the trends, goals and processes of mergers and acquisitions, differentiate the two terms and examine external and internal factors that can hinder the process. We will also find out about the striking advantages that can make a successful merger or an acquisition worthwhile if you have identified the right match for your company and we will eventually learn about the process that is involved in real world M&A activities. In this special bonus module, we will discuss the relationship between profitability and growth on the one hand and the limitations that are faced by small companies on the other. We will learn what organic growth is and that it can be achieved by either protecting and building up our existing customer base and product lines, or by developing new products or markets \u2013 or, in turn, by diversifying our products portfolio. We will acknowledge and address external and internal limitations to growth and \u2013 as a final consideration \u2013 will look into the possibilities of international strategies for growth.  Paired with humorous elements and illustrating examples, the Competitive Strategy and Organization Design specialization is the ideal choice for curious individuals who enjoy unique learning experiences and innovative teaching approaches. Its style is likely to appeal especially to young, middle-aged and young-at-heart learners.The specialization is indended for learners interested in engaging in fundamental theories and concepts of strategy and organization and applying these to practice.

You will apply the TVM concept in real-life problems of financial planning and saving for college. You will also learn more about loans and apply TVM concepts to borrowing and lending. You will realize that \u2014 while the applications are seemingly more complex, but when seen and broken-up into bite-size components \u2014 the framework, principles, and tools remain the same.After completing this course you will have an understanding of the detailed mechanics and reasoning behind any decision you make that has consequences for the future. The deeper exposure to financial transactions you will be applicable in any/all decisions. The great news is that these concepts and skills will transfer to your professional/business decisions. \n\nThis course is part of the four-course Foundational Finance for Strategic Decision Making Specialization. Subtitles: English Subtitles: English The mission of the University of Michigan is to serve the people of Michigan and the world through preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future. This week we will start this course with the first Mega Application that will expose us to more real-world situations confronted by us all. You are strongly encouraged to think through an application and draw timelines to realize that complex applications are a collection of the simpler ones we dealt with Course 1. As you work through the four Mega Applications in this course, look to find the common themes. In this application, we will start with a classic example of saving for a future need - to attend college. This week's second Mega Example is about financial planning, agin something that can serve very useful because we typically work for some time and then want to maintain a standard of living.  The key concepts here are again the same as those developed in the first course, but the issue is one of breaking down more difficult problems into bite-size pieces that resemble the simpler applications and assignments in Course 1. You are strongly encouraged to start attempting the Practice and Graded assignments - each has TEN questions with deliberate overlap with Course 1 and then some challenging scenarios in the later part of the assignments. This week's Mega Application is my favorite because it shows you both the power of finance and its ability to simplify seemingly complex transactions. We all borrow and lend, though at different points in time, and even at the same time. This application is very detailed because it is meant to demonstrate the intuitive power of finance that makes calculations easy.  This is a Mega Application that will help you understand the power of simplicity in conducting financial examples. You are again encouraged to keep practicing and attempting the assignments. In this specialization, you\u2019ll focus on the mechanics and intuition of the main building block of finance \u2014 the time value of money. You\u2019ll learn the structure and basics through assignments and tests that are introductory in nature but with real-world applications.We developed this specialization with the express purpose of enabling you to understand and apply these foundational principles of finance to your everyday life. Understanding how to use finance for personal decisions will also help you understand and excel at making professional decisions. After the successful completion of this series, you will be equipped to make thoughtful decisions based on a framework that uses multiple advances in modern financial theory over the past several decades. The most important features of this specialization are: (a) it is an integrated set of courses with a focus on understanding both the theory and applicability of finance; and (b) it is applied in execution \u2014 everything is covered using examples.\n\nThe four courses in this specialization all build on each other, use real-world examples, and include richly designed assessments/quizzes to test your knowledge and enhance your learning experience. Assessments will progressively build in complexity as you better understand the applicability of finance to complex issues.",

How does an internet router forward packets of network traffic to minimize delay?  How does an aid group allocate resources to its affiliated local partners?To solve such problems, we first represent the key pieces of data in a complex data structure. In this course, you\u2019ll learn about data structures, like graphs, that are fundamental for working with structured real world data.  You will develop, implement, and analyze algorithms for working with this data to solve real world problems.   In addition, as the programs you develop in this course become more complex, we\u2019ll examine what makes for good code and class hierarchy design so that you can not only write correct code, but also share it with other people and maintain it in the future.\n\nThe backbone project in this course will be a route planning application.  You will apply the concepts from each Module directly to building an application that allows an autonomous agent (or a human driver!) to navigate its environment.

Innovation is central to who we are and what we do. Here, students learn that knowledge isn't just acquired in the classroom\u2014life is their laboratory. Welcome to the first week in the third course of our Intermediate Java Programming Specialization.  Once again start with introductions, and in particular introduce the unique structure of this course.  Also, if you're not sure if this course is right for you, we've got an optional pre-course quiz coming right up that can help you figure out if you're in the right place.  If you decide to stay with us (and we really hope you will!) we've got a great backbone project for you: your very own mapping application, inspired by Google Maps!  The core data structure throughout this course is graphs, which may very well be the most fundamental data structure in all of computer science.  Ready to begin?  So are we! This week we'll start getting technical, introducing you to the central data structure in the course: Graphs.  You'll learn the basics and then have a chance to dive in a little deeper into the code, getting ready to start building that Google Maps-like application. This week you'll get the backbone of your map search engine up and running.  In previous courses, including the previous courses in this specialization, you've probably been given most of the classes you needed to complete the assignments.  But learning how to design classes from scratch is a key skill that you will need as you become a more sophisticated Java programmer.  This week we'll give you the tools you need to create a robust and elegant class design for your map search engine.  We'll introduce a similar problem and show you how it can be represented as a graph.  Then we'll introduce two core search algorithms: depth-first search and breadth-first search.  Finally, we'll turn our graph problem into a set of Java classes.   Your task on the programming assignment this week will be to do the same thing, but in the context on the map search engine! In the past two weeks, you've developed a strong understanding of how to design classes to represent a graph and how to use a graph to represent a map.  In this week, you'll add a key feature of map data to our graph representation -- distances -- by adding weights to your edges to produce a \"weighted graph\".  Although this might seem like a small change, the algorithms that work for unweighted graphs may prove ineffective for weighted graphs.  To address this problem, you'll explore more advanced shortest path algorithms.  First, you'll see how to find the shortest path on a weighted graph, then you'll see how to find it more quickly.  In the project, you'll apply these ideas to create the core of any good mapping application: finding the shortest route from one location to another. In this week, we'll go beyond the problem of finding a path between two points, and focus on problems requiring overall path planning.  For example, if you wanted to go on errands and visit 6 different locations before returning home, what is the optimal route? This problem is actually a really well known problem in computer science known as the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP).  Attempting to solve the problem will lead us to explore complexity theory, what it means to be NP-Hard, and how to solve \"hard\" problems using heuristics and approximation algorithms.  We'll end the week by showing how reformulating a problem can have a huge impact: making something which was effectively unsolvable before, now solvable!   You made it to the last week of our course!  We're glad you're still with us.  As a reward, there's no new content to learn this week.  Instead you'll get the opportunity to extend your project in a direction of your own choosing.  We hope you've got some neat ideas for personalizing your map application, and we look forward to seeing them in the peer review gallery.  Submitting to the peer review gallery is optional (though the extension is required), but we hope you'll choose to participate.   This Specialization covers intermediate topics in software development. You\u2019ll learn object-oriented programming principles that will allow you to use Java to its full potential, and you\u2019ll implement data structures and algorithms for organizing large amounts of data in a way that is both efficient and easy to work with. You\u2019ll also practice critically evaluating your own code, and you\u2019ll build technical communication skills that will help you prepare for job interviews and collaborative work as a software engineer. In the final Capstone Project, you\u2019ll apply your skills to analyze data collected from a real-world (social) network. Google has contributed real-world projects and the involvement of its engineers as guest lecturers to these courses. A small, select group of top learners who complete the Specialization will be offered practice interviews with Google recruiters.

        "about": "Optimization is a common form of decision making, and is ubiquitous in our society. Its applications range from solving Sudoku puzzles to arranging seating in a wedding banquet.  The same technology can schedule planes and their crews, coordinate the production of steel, and organize the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Good decisions in manpower and material resources management also allow corporations to improve profit by millions of dollars.  Similar problems also underpin much of our daily lives and are part of determining daily delivery routes for packages, making school timetables, and delivering power to our homes. Despite their fundamental importance, all of these problems are a nightmare to solve using traditional undergraduate computer science methods.This course is intended for students who have completed Basic Modelling for Discrete Optimization. In this course you will learn much more about solving challenging discrete optimization problems by stating the problem in a state-of-the-art high level modeling language, and letting library constraint solving software do the rest.  This course will focus on debugging and improving models, encapsulating parts of models in predicates, and tackling advanced scheduling and packing problems. As you master this advanced technology, you will be able to tackle problems that were inconceivable to solve previously.\n\nWatch the course promotional video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc3cBvtrem0&t=8s Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish The University of Melbourne is an internationally recognised research intensive University with a strong tradition of excellence in teaching, research, and community engagement. Established in 1853, it is Australia's second oldest University. Founded in 1963, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) is a forward looking comprehensive research university with a global vision and a mission to combine tradition with modernity, and to bring together China and the West. CUHK teachers and students hail from all corners of the world. CUHK graduates are connected worldwide through an expansive alumni network. Similar to computer programs, models can have bugs.  In this module, you will see the symptoms (unsatisfiability, too many solutions, too few solutions) of different bugs, and learn methods to discover what is going wrong with your model and how to fix it.  Equipped with these tools, you will be able to develop and debug complex models. In this module, you will learn how to encapsulate a complex constraint definition in a predicate definition to enable its reuse.  This will enable the construction of far more complex models with improved readability in a modular manner.  You will also encounter for the first time a problem with multiple objectives and learn how to compress them into one single objective.  In addition to this, you will learn how to model the banquet seating problem, which will assist you in many occasions in life. Learn how to tackle complex project scheduling problems of various forms, progressively from ones with only basic precedence requirements to ones with unary resources and even cumulative resources. You will see how to model some of the complex constraints that arise in these applications. In this module, you will learn the important application of packing, from the packing of squares to rectilinear shapes with and without rotation.  Again, you will see how to model some of the complex constraints that arise in these applications.   This final module looks at the various forms of symmetries that can appear in discrete optimization problems.  You will learn various methods and special constraints to break such symmetries so as to increase solving efficiency.  You will also learn the notion of dominance, which is a generalization of symmetries, and also dominance breaking techniques.",

We go through the various debugging tools in R and how they can be used to identify problems in code. Profiling tools allow you to see where your code spends its time and to optimize your code for maximum efficiency. Object oriented programming allows you to define custom data types or classes and a set of functions for handling that data type in a way that you define. R has a three different methods for implementing object oriented programming and we will cover them in this section. R is a programming language and a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics, widely used by data analysts, data scientists and statisticians. This Specialization covers R software development for building data science tools. As the field of data science evolves, it has become clear that software development skills are essential for producing and scaling useful data science results and products.This Specialization will give you rigorous training in the R language, including the skills for handling complex data, building R packages, and developing custom data visualizations. You\u2019ll be introduced to indispensable R libraries for data manipulation, like tidyverse, and data visualization and graphics, like ggplot2. You\u2019ll learn modern software development practices to build tools that are highly reusable, modular, and suitable for use in a team-based environment or a community of developers.\n\nThis Specialization is designed to serve both data analysts, who may want to gain more familiarity with hands-on, fundamental software skills for their everyday work, as well as data mining experts and data scientists, who may want to use R to scale their developing and programming skills, and further their careers as data science experts.",

You can meet those challenges by gaining experience with some of the more advanced SQL coding techniques. Through hands-on practice you will write SQL code to use functions and grouping, sub queries, calculated fields, and conditional expressions. In addition, you will experiment with alternative methods of joining tables for data retrieval.\n\nNote: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We\u2019re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.",

        "about": "It used to be the case that everyone viewed webpages on about the same size screen.  But with the explosion of the use of smartphones to access the Internet, the landscape of design has completely changed.  People viewing your site will now expect that it will perform regardless of the platform (smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer).  This ability to respond to any platform is called responsive design.This course will expand upon the basic knowledge of CSS3 to include topics such as wireframes, fluid design, media queries, and the use of existing styling paradigms such as Bootstrap.  After the course, learners will be able to:\n** Explain the mobile-first paradigm and the importance of wireframes in the design phase\n** Create sites that behave across a range of platforms\n** Utilize existing design frameworks such as Bootstrap\n\nThis is the fourth course in the Web Design For Everybody specialization.  A basic understanding of HTML and CSS is expected when you enroll in this class.

What does it mean to have responsive design for your site?  How can you tell if your existing site is responsive?  This week we will begin with the theories behind the \"mobile-first paradigm\" -  the idea that your mobile site should provide everything needed, not a pared-down version of a good page.  We end the week by taking the first concrete step of using fluid measurements in your CSS. This week you will get a chance to put the theories into practice using media queries in your CSS.  These queries can automatically detect the size of the browser being used to view the page so that you can decide what type of look you want to achieve.  There will also be a discussion on common practices for designing your different views at various screen sizes (\"viewports\"). After every good programmer has put in time creating sites from scratch, it is common to utilize existing tools out there.  After all, why recreate the wheel?  The work you have done up to this point will give you the knowledge needed to craft your own unique sites from these frameworks.  This week we will work with Bootstrap, a framework that uses HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript (but don't worry if you have never used JavaScript yourself). This week is dedicated to solving those little issues that pop up when you move from theory to practice.  We look at more advanced framework options and also hear from people who are using the techniques covered in this course. This Specialization covers how to write syntactically correct HTML5 and CSS3, and how to create interactive web experiences with JavaScript. Mastering this range of technologies will allow you to develop high quality web sites that, work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and large screen browsers accessible. During the capstone you will develop a professional-quality web portfolio demonstrating your growth as a web developer and your knowledge of accessible web design. This will include your ability to design and implement a responsive site that utilizes tools to create a site that is accessible to a wide audience, including those with visual, audial, physical, and cognitive impairments.",

We also show  the technique where  the value added Software Defined Network services can be used to ensure the data are delivered through a designated path to the right location. In this module, we discuss the definition of  the authentication, the types of authentication credentials, and the authentication process and related requirements. we learn the  Role Based Access Control, short for RBAC, which is an security approach to restricting system access to authorized users and to  help specify organization's security policies reflecting its organizational structure. We use Docker Universal Control Plan and AWS IAM access control as examples for illustrating how RBAC simplifies the access control specification and management.  In this module, we discuss PMI Privilege Management Infrastructure for managing the authorization of privileges within a system. We use attribute certificates as an instrument to associate access rights of the resources/services in the system to the identities or roles of the intended users of the system.  We compare the differences between the PKI, the public key infrastructure which is focused on identity management, with the PMI which is focused on the management of the privileges authorized for users.  We discuss their difference usages for the access control of the system. We then present the XACML,  which is an eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) for specifying policies. It is an attribute-based access control system (ABAC), where attributes associated with a user or action or resource are inputs into the decision of whether a given user may access a given resource in a particular way. An implementation of ABAC system using Sun\u2019s XACML 2.0 Java reference implementation called ENFORCE is then presented as an example.

        "about": "Hi and welcome to this course! Would you like to learn about the latest valuation methods that may help you to make better business decisions? Then 'Advanced Valuation and Strategy \u2013 M&A, Private Equity, and Venture Capital' by Erasmus University Rotterdam is the right course for you! This course is helpful for executives that need to value complete strategies and for all students interested in corporate finance and strategy. We present the latest tools and show you how to apply them!\n\nWe will revolutionize your way of decision making, by extending static techniques from corporate finance with dynamic methods to quantify strategic thinking. Traditionally, we assess the attractiveness of an investment as a mature business, where future cash flows mainly result from past decisions. But, in an ever-changing world, strategic decisions determine the firm\u2019s long-term success and market value. Yet managers often have to consider these long-term implications using intuition and experience alone, with little guidance from structured, quantitative analysis.\n\nOur treatment goes far beyond the use of standard valuation analysis. We introduce the expanded NPV, which brings together DCF, real options, and game theory. Thinking in terms of options, games, and adaptive strategies may help managers address strategic questions such as: How do you value a leveraged buyout? How can you value a high-tech venture with negative cash flows? When should you invest in new ventures in stages? How can you incorporate rival bidders in the analysis?\n\nThe tools we provide can improve your decisions in business and in daily life.\n\n* Who is this class for?\nWe hope that our course appeals to (graduate) students in finance, economics, and business, as well as to high-ranking professionals and a general audience. This course is particularly interesting for venture capitalists, private equity investors, investment bankers, CEOs, CFOs, and those who aspire these affiliations. We offer this MOOC at 3 levels:\n\n1.Executive Summary: \nThis 1-week module provides critical insights into the principles of corporate valuation and strategy. This is accessible for time-constrained executives and the general audience without any prior knowledge.\n\n2. Student Level:\nThis level involves an understanding of the technical details.  This level requires basic knowledge of concepts in corporate finance, e.g., the time value of money, financial statement analysis, capital structure, and the relation between risk and returns. Learners of this level can skip week 1.\n\n3. Honors Level (honors certificate): \nThis level is challenging, engaging, and compelling to an intellectually rigorous student.

My name is Han Smit, I am Professor of Corporate Finance at Erasmus School of Economics. I will be your lecturer, and together with my team, Dyaran Bansraj and Nishad Matawlie, we are going to take you on a fascinating journey that may change the way you make strategic investment decisions. This executive level\u00a0course\u00a0consists of a series of accessible animation videos. Step by step we develop the conceptual frameworks and new valuation principles for strategic investments that are difficult to value with traditional tools. These new valuation methods can be particularly interesting for venture capitalists, private equity investors, investment bankers, CEOs, and CFOs.\u00a0This executive level\u00a0course\u00a0is meant for those who want to be updated on the latest insights\u00a0in corporate strategy\u00a0and valuation techniques.\u00a0You can walk through the fundamentals of the course in less than a week! If you wish to follow the student level, you can skip this week (don't worry, you won't miss out on anything)! We show you how to apply DCF approaches and provide case applications illustrating the powerful potential of this valuation methodology. We consider historical analysis, the estimation of free cash flows, various DCF approaches, and multiples valuation. In the assignments we consider specialized topics such as the valuation of leveraged buyouts. After this module you will be familiar with DCF approaches and will be able to relate them to strategy. This module closes the gap between traditional corporate finance and strategic planning by linking corporate strategy to the market value. We can assess the value of a company through the expanded NPV criterion, which is able to capture the value of the firm's growth options. We review various strategic paradigms that analyze the underlying sources of this growth option value, focusing on industry analysis, firms' internal resources and dynamic capabilities. After this module you will be able to recognise the strategic growth option value in the market value of a company. This module reviews the basic concepts and valuation principles of real options. Real options theory quantifies decision making under uncertainty and stresses the importance of wait-and-see flexibility, suggesting that managers should wait until major uncertainties are resolved and the project is more clearly beneficial. Since it recognizes that investments tend to be sequentially related over time, real options analysis is particularly suitable for valuing strategies in addition to isolated projects. After this module you will be able to quantify the flexibility component of the strategic growth option value. This is an important capability when valuing high-tech companies. This module provides an overview of the basic principles of game theory, which are essential for our understanding of strategic decisions. Strategic investment decisions are often made in a context in which decision makers must consider the deliberate (re)actions of rivals. Combining real options with games helps us to understand competitive behavior under uncertainty. Practical examples of option games include: competitive bidding in acquisitions and new product development decisions (in car manufacturing, mobile phones and consumer electronics). After this module you will be able to quantify the strategic component in the strategic growth option value. This is important for understanding strategic decisions of companies with high growth option value.",

        "about": "This course examines the relation of advertising to society, culture, history, and the economy.  Using contemporary theories about visual communications, we learn to analyze the complex levels of meaning in both print advertisements and television commercials.About the Course\n\nThe course covers a wide range of topics, including the origins of advertising, the creation of ads, the interpretation of ads, the depiction of race, class, gender, and sexuality in advertising, sex and selling, adverting and ethics, and the future of advertising.

Others will be visits to the sites of ad agencies in the US and abroad, open access websites that deal with course topics, and open-access journal articles. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Duke University has about 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students and a world-class faculty helping to expand the frontiers of knowledge. The university has a strong commitment to applying knowledge in service to society, both near its North Carolina campus and around the world. Focus on 3 definitions of advertising, one of which emphasizes its antiquity, another its modernity and connections to capitalist society, and a third that traces its evolution from face-to-face salesmanship through print, radio, TV, and now the Internet.  In addition, a brief history of American advertising from its European origins through  the colonial period in America when most manufactured goods were imported, to the advent of mass production in 19th century America, mass consumption (and the emergence of contemporary advertising as a means to facilitate it), to the present. Focus on the public\u2019s fascination with the idea of subliminal advertising (beginning in the 1950s) and continuing somewhat into the present.  Public distrust of advertising.  Review of the evidence (pro and con) concerning subliminal advertising.  Discussion of ethics and advertising, the role of the FTC and various self-policing industry boards that aim to control deceptive advertising. This week considers how we understand the meaning of an ad.  It considers the problem of author intentionality (largely available to us in the process of understanding ads) and argues that the audience for the ad is perhaps the most important author of its meaning.  Borrowing from the field of art history, it discusses interpretative strategies of various sorts. Switching gears this week from looking from outside advertising at it, this week is devoted to the \u201cinsider\u201d perspective on the making of ads.  It looks at the various functional divisions of ad agencies (management, creative, research, and media) and the roles they play in producing an ad.  It tracks the production of an ad from development of a strategy with a client company, the development of creative concepts, the production of ads, optional audience testing, and finally placement in appropriate media.  Also discussed: brands and brand management strategies. This week focuses on what ads teach about race, class, gender, and sexuality as a kind of secondary messages beyond the overt messages promoting products and services.  For example, an orange juice commercial may promote the health benefits of orange juice but it also is likely to show the product in its context of use at breakfast.  The imagery in the ad will lay out who does the serving, who cooks the breakfast, who gets to sit and be served, what a family should look like, and so on.  Through analysis of these secondary messages, we come to learn that advertising instills ideas about gender, race, social class, and sexuality.  We will also study the depiction of these themes in the popular TV program \"Mad Men,\" allowing us to talk about how these issues were managed in the lives of ad agency people as well as in the ads they produced. Sexual imagery permeates modern advertising, but does it actually help see goods and services? The verdict on this is not a clear yes or no.  But there is another very important question wrapped up in all this:  what kind of sex does advertising sell?  Some scholars believe that advertising teaches us a great deal about sex itself, plays a significant role in defining our culture\u2019s ideas about what is sexy, and helps shape our ideas about sexuality. The present moment in advertising history is one of great turmoil.  The TV commercial is rapidly fading from its preeminence as the major advertising format.  The once mass audiences for television programming and accompanying ads are already diminished by the proliferation of channels, the ability of consumers to time shift, and so on.  It is the Internet however that is transforming advertising and challenging its very existence.  Social media, consumer written ads, popup ads that are highly targeted to consumers on the basis of their purchasing and surfing habits, and so on make the future unpredictable.  One author predicts its demise in his book, \"The End of Advertising as We Know It.\"  We will examine emergent trends  in the seemingly never ending battle of finding the best means of establishing communication between companies and their prospective clients.",

We will examine promising titanium aluminides and shape-memory titanium alloys. Titanium alloys have unique properties and are very promising as aerospace materials \nTitanium alloys are used in heavily-loaded airframe sections, undercarriage parts, skins to high Mach speed aircraft, jet engines, and many other aircraft components requiring high strength, fracture toughness and resistance to fatigue, creep and corrosion. \nThese mechanical properties are superior to lightweight structural materials, including aluminum alloys and magnesium alloys. This module will introduce you to high strength steels. Steel is used as an aerospace material, but to a lesser extent than titanium, aluminum, and composites. High strength steel cannot be replaced with other materials.Advantages of using steel in highly-loaded aircraft structures include high stiffness, strength, fatigue resistance and fracture toughness. \nIn this part of the video course, we will deal with steels used in landing gear and other high-strength components, namely: maraging steels, medium-carbon low-alloy steels, and stainless steels. This module will introduce you to powder metal materials and modern technologies used to manufacture them. Powders are used in the manufacture of complex parts or when increased heat resistance is required. \"Sweating\" highly porous materials are used to prevent icing on aircraft.Metal powder compositions are of particular interest due to the rapid development of additive technologies. You will learn about the requirements for powders used in additive manufacturing. We told you about a variety of aerospace materials. Now imagine you are an aircraft designer. Do the final task.",

Over a period of five weeks, the course covers a logical account of historical events and decisions that have shaped the current political-economical landscape of Sub-Saharan Africa - from the pre-colonial and the colonial era, to the era of liberalisation, modern day Africa and the future prospects of the continent. One does not need to have a dedicated historical interest to benefit from the course. The course targets a broad range of professional groups, actors, organisations and curious individuals - all sharing a common interest in improving their understanding of the limitations and opportunities inherent in the Sub-Saharan African continent. Subtitles: English, Swedish Subtitles: English, Swedish Lund University was founded in 1666 and has for a number of years been ranked among the world\u2019s top 100 universities. The University has 47 700 students and 7 500 staff based in Lund, Sweden. Lund University unites tradition with a modern, dynamic, and highly international profile. With eight different faculties and numerous research centres and specialized institutes, Lund is the strongest research university in Sweden and one of Scandinavia's largest institutions for education and research. The university annually attracts a large number of international students and offers a wide range of courses and programmes taught in English. In addition, International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics (IIIEE) is part of the university and works to advance strategies for sustainable solutions through cutting edge interdisciplinary research, high-quality innovative education, and effective communication and strong partnerships. In this introductory module I begin by speaking of my intentions when creating the course as well as the course structure and literature. Next, I explain the key theoretical concepts that I use throughout the course. Finally, I give an overview of how the literature on African history has evolved. I spend limited time discussing Africa\u2019s long history before colonization. Instead, I have chosen to focus the course on more recent events. Still, I aim to convey a basic understanding of the long-term development of economic systems, state formation, and trade networks. European colonialism had a profound impact on Africa\u2019s development, but the way it affected people\u2019s lives differed between regions, societies, and groups of people. I this module, I problematize and specify the impact. I also discuss the agency of different European and African interest groups. After the end of World War II, African countries experienced both progress and crisis. This module covers the time from the early independence movements to the effects of the Structural Adjustment Programs. The central theme is the challenge of economic diversification and sectorial change.  Since the 1960s, there has been major socio-economic change in Africa. I organize this change thematically to discuss population growth, urbanization, and regional integration. I then move on to scrutinize the current positive economic and political development. I end with discussing Africa\u2019s changing role in the global economy.",

        "about": "Learn why the hope and excitement of the Arab Spring is gone, why so many Arab states are falling apart, why the youth are so frustrated, why there are so many refugees, and what can be done about it.The so-called Arab Spring appeared to end decades of exceptionalism and bring the Arab world back into the mainstream of global developments. The rebellions promised the return of politics and the reassertion of popular sovereignty against their corrupt and geriatric leaders. Much hope and flowery language greeted the young men and women who deposed their leaders and tried to build new, better societies.\n\nToday, the Arab world is in deep crisis. Of the 22 member states of the Arab League, at least five have essentially collapsed: Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Syria exist only in name today, as their territories have fallen to competing, murderous armed groups. In the remaining countries, the old autocracies have reasserted themselves. The repression at home is now worsened by regional conflict on an unprecedented scale, and the resulting frustration has led to the biggest refugee flows in recent memory. What went wrong?\n\nThis course offers an overview of the structural shortcomings of Arab states and societies, which help us understand why the democratic awakening did not happen but instead \u201chas given way to civil wars, ethnic, sectarian and regional divisions and the reassertion of absolutism.\u201d This raises the obvious and renewed question whether there is something inherent in the Arab, and by analogy Muslim, condition that makes them special. Does this condition make this part of the world impervious to generally observable trends towards greater accountability, popular participation in political decision-making, greater generation and fairer division of economic wealth? Join this course to find out! Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish The University of Copenhagen is the oldest University in Denmark - founded in 1479, and with over 38,000 students and more than 9,000 employees. The purpose of the University is to conduct research and provide education to the highest academic level. Based in Denmark's capital city it is one of the top research institutions in Europe.  In this section, you will become acquainted with some of the mistakes that were made in the decades prior to the outbreak of the recent Arab rebellions. These shortcomings have led to stunted and underperforming political systems, much at variance with developments elsewhere. At the heart of most of the enduring problems plaguing the Arab world is the availability of essentially free income flowing to the governments of the region. These \u2018rents\u2019 have sustained a repressive arrangement in which citizens pay little or no taxes and have no voice. Social action inevitably produces institutions, namely values, stable, repeated patterns of behaviour. In this section, you will learn what institutions are, how they come about, how their relative effectiveness is measures, how and why they decline, and why all that matters.  This section deals with the material bases of popular discontent, especially the connection between the states\u2019 explicit promises of delivering welfare that have become increasingly unsustainable in the face of exploding population growth and falling revenues. Structural changes beyond anyone\u2019s control lead to different ways of living and, thus, value changes. With explosive population growth, social institutions have not kept up and norms are contested, often violently. Arab education and research especially have underperformed. Tying together some of the structural shortcomings that have produced the dysfunction that drove the Arab rebellions, this section casts a somewhat gloomy picture about the formidable tasks ahead if these societies want to redress the causes of discontent and return to stability.",

        "about": "An introduction to some of the most astonishing architectural monuments the world has ever known\u2014Gothic cathedrals.  We shall study the art, literature, intellectual life, economics, and new social arrangements that arose in the shadow of the cathedrals and that were such an important part of the revival of cities in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.  The goal of the course is a better appreciation of the High Middle Ages, a world that is still recognizably our own. Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish For more than 300 years, Yale University has inspired the minds that inspire the world. Based in New Haven, Connecticut, Yale brings people and ideas together for positive impact around the globe. A research university that focuses on students and encourages learning as an essential way of life, Yale is a place for connection, creativity, and innovation among cultures and across disciplines.  An introduction to the history of Paris in the centuries of chaos following the death of Charlemagne in 814 and the building of the first Gothic cathedral at Saint-Denis, just north of Paris.  The old abbey church, where the kings of France were buried, was inadequate, and so a new building project was undertaken by Abbot Suger, who financed the new building through efficient land management and the commercial Fair of Lendit along a trade route between northern and southern Europe. Here we encounter the portrait of Abbot Suger via his account of how and why he built Saint-Denis, what is portrayed on the West fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral, and how the doctrine of God as light, encountered in a book which had come from Byzantium to the abbey centuries earlier, was translated into architectural form.  We see some of the objects that are part of the treasury of Saint-Denis and discuss the Abbot\u2019s notion of \u201canagogical uplift\u201d as a way of moving\u2014via stained glass\u2014between the Old and New Testaments and from the material to the spiritual plane. Filling in the background of Romanesque churches that preceded Gothic buildings, we discuss the origins and engineering innovations of the new style of religious architecture.  These include ribbed vaults, reinforced pillars, pointed arches, flying buttresses, and a modular system of bay construction; all of which permits the construction of higher and lighter, thinner walls filled with stained glass. Moving to the heart of Paris, we explore the initial construction of Notre-Dame and the innovations that were undertaken almost as soon as the building began.  We discuss the sculptural programs of Notre-Dame\u2019s West fa\u00e7ade, including the portal which depicts the life of Saint Anne, Christ\u2019s grandmother, and Mary, his mother and the central portal of the Last Judgment.  Along the south side, we discover the story of the stoning of Saint Stephen; and, along the North, the miracle of Theophilus and the Virgin.  Moving inside the cathedral, we encounter the stunning rose windows of Notre-Dame. Here we examine the cathedral in terms of surrounding intellectual and everyday life.  A reading of Peter Abelard\u2019s autobiography, The Story of my Misfortunes, testifies to the growth of the scholastic method in the context of the earliest university culture; and two verse comic tales, \u201cThe Crucified Priest\u201d and \u201cThe Peekaboo Priest\u201d introduce the new mentality of the inhabitant of towns with emphasis on cleverness, quick thinking, and timing along with an anti-clerical spirit. In Module 6 we move West of Paris to the cathedral of Chartres where Gothic architecture hits its stride.  We explore the history of Chartres, its unique and mysterious architectural features, and its miraculous relic\u2014the Holy Tunic.  We discuss the financing of Chartres as seen in the windows donated by merchant which depict the various urban trades alongside the sculpture of the West fa\u00e7ade, the rose and lancet stained glass windows, and the secular Zodiac and Charlemagne windows, the latter of which is linked to important literary works of the period. In Module 7 we examine in some detail The Song of Roland, portions of which are depicted in the stained glass of Chartres, and we explore the relationship of relics from the Middle East to cathedral building. In Module 8 we explore Saint Louis\u2019s building of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris as a house of glass, a new Ark of the Covenant, to house the relics he had amassed.  Using Jean de Joinville\u2019s Life of Saint-Louis as our source, we encounter the Saint King\u2019s life as a crusader, his death, canonization, and the miracles performed by his body on his way to sainthood. By way of conclusion, we explore the history of Gothic cathedrals from the Middle Ages to the present.",

Together, UVA and Monticello are recognized internationally as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Chinese (Simplified), Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Chinese (Simplified), Russian, English, Spanish A premier institution of higher education, The University of Virginia offers outstanding academics, world-class faculty, and an inspiring, supportive environment. Founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, the University is guided by his vision of discovery, innovation, and development of the full potential of students from all walks of life. Through these courses, global learners have an opportunity to study with renowned scholars and thought leaders. Thomas Jefferson is an American icon.  He has also been one of the most polarizing and controversial figures in American history.  In this introductory module, we\u2019ll explore how Jefferson\u2019s reputation has changed and evolved over the last two centuries.  We\u2019ll discover what Jefferson considered to be his most important contribution to the \u201cAge of Enlightenment\u201d in which he was living.  We\u2019ll discuss why some people in both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have viewed Jefferson and his ideas with skepticism or worse while others have embraced Jefferson.  Overall, learning about how people from many different backgrounds and perspectives have interpreted Jefferson throughout history will help us understand why it\u2019s so important to think critically and honestly about Jefferson\u2019s life and legacy today. No document is more closely associated with Jefferson than the Declaration of Independence.  Listing it as the first of three achievements on his tombstone, Jefferson clearly believed the Declaration to be of profound importance.  Generations of Americans have agreed, constantly quoting its phrases and invoking its ideas.  But do we really understand what Jefferson was trying to do when he wrote the Declaration?  In this module, we\u2019ll explore the Revolutionary context in which Jefferson lived and worked.  We\u2019ll ask why the Declaration takes the form that it does, and also what Jefferson hoped it would accomplish.  Surprisingly, the parts of the Declaration that we celebrate most frequently today may not be the ones Jefferson would have understood to be the most important. The man who wrote in the Declaration of Independence that \u201call men are created equal\u201d was a lifelong slaveowner whose affluence rested on the exploitation of hundreds of African Americans.  In this module, we travel to Montalto, the mountain overlooking Jefferson\u2019s home and plantation on Monticello, to try to gain some perspective on this great tension in Jefferson\u2019s life and thought.  Our goal will be neither simply to exonerate nor to castigate Jefferson, but rather to understand how he viewed slavery and his relationship to it.  Only by confronting and considering this complicated, frustrating, and tragic chapter in American history can we come to a more complete and nuanced understanding of Thomas Jefferson and his legacy.  As students attending the University Jefferson founded, it is especially important to engage this topic. The role of religion in public life continues to be a topic of debate today in both the United States and around the world.  Thomas Jefferson was never happier than when his Bill for Religious Freedom was finally enacted in Virginia in 1786.  In this module, we\u2019ll try to understand why Jefferson believed freedom of religion to be so essential to the future of the United States.  To do this, we\u2019ll explore the historical context in which Jefferson developed his ideas about the proper relationship between religious denominations and the state.  We\u2019ll also investigate Jefferson\u2019s own faith\u2014a subject of much controversy from his own day through the present.  Considering Jefferson\u2019s serious engagement with questions of religion will help us understand the kinds of communities and society he hoped would take hold and flourish in the new nation. Founding the University of Virginia in 1819 was the most obvious example of Jefferson\u2019s interest in education, but it was by no means the first time he considered the subject.  Indeed, education was one of Jefferson\u2019s constant preoccupations.  In this session, we\u2019ll discuss Jefferson\u2019s ideas about education as they developed over the course of his life, from the ambitious plan for a state-supported system of schools outlined in his \u201cBill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge,\u201d to his conclusion in the early nineteenth century that the other institutions of higher learning that existed in the United States just weren\u2019t suited to forming the leaders of a free republic.  Throughout the discussion, we\u2019ll try to understand why Jefferson was so focused on education by asking what he believed was at stake if Americans failed in their duty to provide proper instruction for future generations. In 1789, Jefferson wrote a letter to James Madison from Paris in which he asserted that \u201cthe earth belongs to the living.\u201d  Calculating that a single generation could be said to last nineteen years, he proposed that no debts should be incurred that could not be paid off in nineteen years; that all laws should be re-written every nineteen years; and that Americans should re-write even their constitutions every nineteen years.  Madison thought the ideas Jefferson outlined in this letter to be wildly impractical, and most commentators since then have come to the same conclusion.  In this module, however, we\u2019ll explore what Jefferson was getting at in claiming that \u201cthe earth belongs to the living.\u201d  In so doing, we\u2019ll discover how this phrase expresses an idea that lies at the very core of Jefferson\u2019s conception of equality, democracy, and the American nation.

We promote innovation, encourage discovery and support the extension of knowledge in ways unique to the state of Colorado and beyond. We use the brain to understand the world around us. Change is no exception except for we are biologically wired to process change at the primal level first. To understand how to become agile, we have to understand what happens in our brain automatically. In this module, you will learn the foundations of the neuroscience of change. By the end of it, you will be able to articulate the inner-mechanics that have a major impact on how we perceive any change event. Every action begins with figuring out the end goal and the current state. In this module, you will work through the materials and the exercises that will help you determine where you want to be as a leader and where you are today as it relates to change. You will also begin developing an action plan to bridge the gap between those two journey points and will begin addressing the psychological aspects of fear that might be holding you back today. You now know the end goal and the current state. But how do you change the things you\u2019ve been thinking and doing for a long time and how do you consciously design a new agile mindset? In this module, you gain additional insight into your own pattern formation, and you will learn practical tools for overcoming established ways of thinking and building a new mindset.  Every thought begins in our brain. As you are developing a new mindset, it\u2019s important to support it until it becomes second nature. In this module, you will learn the tools of positive psychology that will help you create healthy mental hygiene, which will be key to sustaining the mindset of an agile leader, building personal change resiliency, and being at ease with change.  Action is the driver of transformation. After you have established your end goal, determined where you are today, broke down your psychological barriers and fears associated with change, and designed a practice to support an agile mindset, you will be challenged to take it one step further. By taking action, you will continue to re-set and raise your initial change-tolerance baseline, little by little. By the end of the module, you will build awareness of the most common pitfalls that could get in your way of reaching your highest change-tolerance potential and will understand how to overcome these. Constant fast change has become a reality of our time. Agile has become a popular leadership philosophy and a project management methodology for addressing this reality. While the theory is simple, it\u2019s much more challenging to become Agile in practice.To bridge the gap between an easy theory and complex application, you will learn three critical success components for executing the complexity of Agile in practice: the neuroscience of change, social psychology, and change management.\n\nIn this specialization, you will learn how to become an agile leader, how to build agile teams by using Agile philosophy and Scrum tools, and how to approach transforming a traditional organization into agile.\n\nThis specialization will prepare you to build change-resiliency within yourself, your team, and your organization and implement Agile practices where appropriate to leverage its maximum benefits.",

We collaborate to meet the diverse needs of our students and communities.  We promote innovation, encourage discovery and support the extension of knowledge in ways unique to the state of Colorado and beyond. In the first module, you will focus on your personal transformation. Your completed Agile Leader Workbook will be your starting point. You will complete the personal transformation section of the roadmap, develop a Product and Sprint Backlog, or, in other words, plan a Sprint.  Even though this exercise is focused on you, you can easily apply the same steps and planning process to mentoring and coaching situations. In the second module, you will focus on training your newly formed team you will be leading at Nike on principles of Agile and Scrum. How would you teach someone who has no experience and knowledge about agility, change resiliency, and Scrum? In this module, you will prepare for leading this change based on the background information presented in the case study. You will complete the team section of the transformation roadmap, and develop your Product and Sprint Backlog for training your team to become Agile. \nThis part of the exercise will give you the experience of planning a transformation of a brand-new-to-Agile team. In the third module, your goal is to develop a change management plan for advancing Agile within Nike. You will develop your plan based on the information about the company and where it stands on its Agile journey presented in the case study. Needless to say, there are some opportunities, and it\u2019s your job to help capitalize on these opportunities that will propel Nike to the next level of Agile adoption. You will complete the last section of the transformation roadmap, and create a 4-5 page transformation plan by applying change management theories and tools you have previously learned. \nYou may choose to create a plan for the company you work for, or do both! If you choose to do both, use Nike case study as a practice opportunity. Constant fast change has become a reality of our time. Agile has become a popular leadership philosophy and a project management methodology for addressing this reality. While the theory is simple, it\u2019s much more challenging to become Agile in practice.To bridge the gap between an easy theory and complex application, you will learn three critical success components for executing the complexity of Agile in practice: the neuroscience of change, social psychology, and change management.\n\nIn this specialization, you will learn how to become an agile leader, how to build agile teams by using Agile philosophy and Scrum tools, and how to approach transforming a traditional organization into agile.\n\nThis specialization will prepare you to build change-resiliency within yourself, your team, and your organization and implement Agile practices where appropriate to leverage its maximum benefits.",

We collaborate to meet the diverse needs of our students and communities.  We promote innovation, encourage discovery and support the extension of knowledge in ways unique to the state of Colorado and beyond. Agile was born out of necessity driven by a changing business environment. But what triggered this change exactly? This week, you will define change and transformation, and examine change intensity levels and the reasons behind change acceleration. Because change management plays a critical role in helping us successfully transform organizations from traditional to agile, you will be introduced to a brief history and the reasons behind the creation of change management theories. Agile leadership is a fairly new concept, and it is typically used in contrast to traditional leadership. This week, you will continue to build the foundational vocabulary for this Specialization by defining a traditional and agile leader and identifying their key characteristics. Are you wondering which one is better? You will be able to answer this question by the end of this week (the answer might surprise you). You will complete the week by analyzing yourself as a leader to understand where you fall on the agility scale. You will be using this assessment in Course 2 to benchmark your personal transformation. In this module, we will transition into the realm of the team. In order to transform your team, you need to understand the difference between a traditional and agile one. You will learn the definitions and key characteristics of both. You will also be introduced to the role and responsibility of a leader in leading an agile team. You will conclude the week by assessing your team\u2019s level of agility. Similarly to your own assessment, you will be using your team\u2019s baseline assessment to design an agile transformation plan later in the specialization. In the last module of this course, we will expand the concepts of traditional and agile to an organizational level. You will learn the definitions and key characteristics of a traditional and agile organization. At the end of the module, you will analyze an organization for its agility. By the end of the last module, you will have a strong foundational knowledge of concepts for the continued journey of Agile Leadership. You will use the three completed assessments when building a comprehensive roadmap for agile transformation as a part of the Capstone course. Constant fast change has become a reality of our time.

But it doesn't have to be this way. Agile and design thinking offer a different--and effective--approach to product development, one that results in valuable solutions to meaningful problems. In this course, you\u2019ll learn how to determine what's valuable to a user early in the process--to frontload value--by focusing your team on testable narratives about the user and creating a strong shared perspective. This course is supported by the Batten Institute at UVA\u2019s Darden School of Business.

Through these courses, global learners have an opportunity to study with renowned scholars and thought leaders. The agile practices that deliver excellent product are well understood, but they take focus, energy, and confidence to apply. This week, we\u2019ll identify what\u2019s hard about creating excellent products and how agile can help. We'll begin with a discussion of the Agile Manifesto- what motivated it and how it defines agile. Then we\u2019ll get into the practical part- the problems agile solves, how to focus your time and energy, and how you\u2019ll know if your practice of agile is working.  The best way to avoid building something nobody wants is to start with somebody in mind. In the design world, we talk about that \"somebody\" through a \u2018persona\u2019. Personas and problem scenarios (aka 'jobs-to-be-done') focus development on driving toward a valuable outcome for your user vs. just generating output. In this module, you\u2019ll learn to focus your work by developing personas, problem scenarios, and alternatives using best practices from design thinking. Now we\u2019re going to transition from drafting personas and hypothesizing user needs to testing those assumptions and translating what you\u2019ve learned into agile user stories. We\u2019ll step through how you create an interview guide to ask your users the right questions and then we\u2019ll dive into agile user stories. User stories are a standard feature of agile and serve as a day-to-day focal point for driving to value.  The agile user story is your day-to-day focal point for making sure you\u2019re building something valuable for your user. It\u2019s how you discuss that within your team and how you anchor your subsequent testing. In this module, you\u2019ll learn how to facilitate the creation and use of stories within your team. ",

In this course, you will focus on leading change at an organizational level and scaling Agile appropriately. \n\nWhen studying Agile application success stories and theory, it's easy to think in terms of adopting \"best practices.\" However, what's best for one industry, company, and most importantly, culture is not always the best for another. Not every aspect of the business is suitable for the application of Agile. Not every organization will benefit from adopting Agile, and not every leader will facilitate yet another change to success.\n\nIn this course, you will be introduced to seven different change management theories and learn how to best use and apply them in practice. You will also learn how to scale Agile in your organization, what to look for when looking for best use cases, and what signs serve as clear indicators that Agile is not an appropriate philosophy to apply.

We collaborate to meet the diverse needs of our students and communities.  We promote innovation, encourage discovery and support the extension of knowledge in ways unique to the state of Colorado and beyond. Knowing how to lead change in an organization is a critical skill for any leader to have. Regardless of the scope, complexity, and size of a particular change, you must be able to create a clear path to get buy-in from others on your team and in your organization. Where do you start? You start at the beginning, of course! When I say \"at the beginning,\" I mean understanding conceptually how to look at change, chunk it into manageable pieces, and plan for its complexity. In this module, you will begin to learn various change management models. My goal is to help you develop a well-rounded understanding of change leadership and change management. We will begin with a straightforward model proposed by Kurt Lewin and transition to McKinsey 7-S Framework. In this module, we will continue to expand on change management. You will add five additional change management models to your toolbelt. They are Nudge theory, ADKAR, Kotter\u2019s 8-step model, Bridge\u2019s Transition model, and Kubler-Ross Five Stages Model. I will be sharing practical examples of how and when you use each model, and when to use them together.By the end of the module, you should begin recognizing themes and patterns across all seven theories and start developing comfort and ease applying them to any project. Agile is a relatively simple theory. But how and where do you begin transforming a traditional organization? In this module, I will share a simple framework for starting on the path to an Agile enterprise and will explain three stages of Agile adoption as you start to scale it. By the end of the module, you will be able to identify commonalities and differences between companies that successfully adopted Agile by looking at case studies of Amazon, Tesla, Target, Spotify, Netflix, and Salesforce. Constant fast change has become a reality of our time. Agile has become a popular leadership philosophy and a project management methodology for addressing this reality.

As one of Canada\u2019s top universities, we\u2019re known for excellence across the humanities, sciences, creative arts, business, engineering and health sciences. Welcome to the first module! In this module, you will be learning some basic principles that you will need for effective planning. You will start this module off with an introduction to planning. You will then learn about how planning, and the approach you take to planning, can reduce uncertainty in your project. We will then move onto learning how to breakdown a project into small, manageable pieces, and how to organize those pieces. Finally, we will go over the differences between estimates, targets, and commitments. Together, these lessons will build a good base for learning planning techniques at both the release and iteration level.  Welcome to module 2! Now that you\u2019ve gotten your feet wet with general principles in project planning, let\u2019s talk about some specific ways that you can use to implement those techniques. We\u2019ll first discuss the concepts of story points and velocity, then move into how time boxing can be used to improve your project efficiency. We\u2019ll then introduce the Gantt chart, a basic tried and true method of visualizing project tasks. We\u2019ll finish off with techniques for planning your project at a release level, which will set the stage for iteration planning in the next module. This module will be focusing on planning techniques at the iteration or sprint level. You will start by looking at various techniques for estimating task time. You will then look at task dependencies in more detail. This will come in handy when you learn two visual planning charts--the Critical Path Method chart, and the PERT chart. Finally, you will learn the process for creating an iteration plan. By the end of this module, you will have the tools you need to plan sprints or iterations for development.  You\u2019ve made it to the last module, congratulations! Here, we\u2019re going to talk about what can cause projects to fail. We\u2019ll start off by discussing common causes of failures, including anti-patterns. Then, you\u2019ll learn how to assess risks, looking at their likelihood and potential impact on the project. We\u2019ll end on an optimistic note by leaving you with strategies for intervening when risks present themselves and avoiding those risks to begin with. In this Software Product Management Specialization, you will master Agile software management practices to lead a team of developers and interact with clients. In the final Capstone Project, you will practice and apply management techniques to realistic scenarios that you will face as a Software Product Manager.

        "about": "Agile teams use \u201cjust enough\u201d planning and an incremental approach to accomplishing the work of the team. Every project and every team uses a custom agile methodology. This course discusses common foundational principles and practices used by agile methodologies, providing the student a flexible set of tools to use in any role (e.g. product owner, scrum master, project manager, team member) on any agile team. This course mainly discusses agile and lean principles, the kanban and scrum agile methodologies, and uses Atlassian Jira Software Cloud as the main software tool to apply hands-on learning of the topics. The course includes instruction on \"classic\" Jira projects as well as the new \"next-gen\" Jira projects.Students can use the free plan of Atlassian Jira Software Cloud to complete the hands-on labs associated with this course. By the time you have completed this course, you will have a strong foundational understanding of agile principles and practices, and strong hands-on experience with Atlassian Jira Software Cloud. You will be the site administrator for your Jira account, so you will be able to perform basic administration tasks on your site. You should be able to continuously configure your Jira project(s) to match your team's custom agile methodology.\n\nYou can watch the videos and take the quizzes from your phone if you want, but the hands-on labs using Atlassian Jira Software Cloud require you to have a Windows, Mac or Linux computer.\n\nThis course tries to be as concise as possible. It will probably take you about 6-12 hours to go through, but your mileage may vary. It is highly encouraged that you apply what you learn to managing personal agile projects after the course is complete. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Our missionWe believe all teams have potential to do amazing things.\nFrom space travel and DNA sequencing, to video games and nonprofits, our mission is to unleash the potential in every team and help advance humanity through the power of software. This module provides an overview of the agile mindset. It introduces Atlassian Jira as a tool used to implement agile principles for team project work. Students will be provided a free Jira Software Cloud license in order to go through the hands-on exercises in this course. We cover the importance of visualizing work, and provide an overview of the kanban agile method. Students will create a custom kanban board. This module start with an overview of scrum, including scrum concepts such as increments, sprints, sprint goals, backlogs, estimation, velocity, common scrum reports, roles and events.  You will then execute a sprint using Jira. The rest of the module focuses more on the \"why\" of agile, and provided a foundational understanding of lean and agile principles. The Toyota Production System is discussed, as this could be considered as the foundation of lean thinking. The Agile Manifesto is also discussed in quite some detail. This module focuses on configuring Jira to match your agile process. This is a more hands-on module than the previous module. Every team has a unique, continuously evolving agile process. Their tools need to be able to adapt to these changes. We will start by discussing searching, then discuss Jira Query Language (JQL). A solid understanding of JQL helps with the rest of the course and in your continuing use of Jira after the course. We will discuss creating filters, custom issue types and configuring issues to show the information that your team cares about. In this module, we continue configuring Jira in order to be able to match the tool to our team's custom agile process. We will discuss and create epics, which are large issues that may contain other issues. We will discuss and create versions, which are a set of issues that usually make up a product update.  We discuss users and permissions. Since you are the administrator of the free Jira Software Cloud that you use for this course, you should know how to invite users to your site and configure permissions so that the right access is granted to users. We end the course with a final project. You will be asked to configure Jira to keep up with your team's continuous changes to their agile process. ",

        "about": "Trotz aller guten Absichten, harter Arbeit und solider Ideen entwickeln zu viele Teams Produkte, die niemand will, die niemand verwenden kann und die niemand kauft. Das muss aber nicht so sein. Eine agile und designorientierte Denkweise bietet einen anderen \u2013 und effektiven \u2013 Ansatz f\u00fcr die Produktentwicklung, der wertvolle L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr bedeutungsvolle Probleme liefert. In diesem Kurs erfahren Sie, wie Sie in den Anfangsphasen des Prozesses feststellen k\u00f6nnen, was f\u00fcr einen Nutzer wertvoll ist \u2013 um diesen Wert zu steigern \u2013, indem Sie den Fokus Ihres Teams auf pr\u00fcfbare Geschichten \u00fcber den Nutzer lenken und eine starke gemeinsame Perspektive schaffen. Dieser Kurs wird vom Batten Institute der Darden School of Business der UVA unterst\u00fctzt. Die Mission des Batten Institute ist es, die Welt durch Unternehmertum und Innovation zu verbessern: www.batteninstitute.org. Subtitles: German, English, Arabic Subtitles: German, English, Arabic A premier institution of higher education, The University of Virginia offers outstanding academics, world-class faculty, and an inspiring, supportive environment. Founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, the University is guided by his vision of discovery, innovation, and development of the full potential of students from all walks of life. Through these courses, global learners have an opportunity to study with renowned scholars and thought leaders. Die agilen Praktiken, die ein ausgezeichnetes Produkt liefern, sind allgemein bekannt, aber ihre Anwendung erfordert Fokus, Energie und Vertrauen. Diese Woche werden wir herausfinden, was bei der Entwicklung exzellenter Produkte schwierig ist und inwiefern es hilfreich sein kann, agil zu arbeiten. Wir beginnen mit einer Diskussion \u00fcber das agile Manifest \u2013 was es veranlasst hat und wie es agiles Arbeiten definiert. Dann kommen wir zum praktischen Teil \u2013 den Problemen, die sich agil l\u00f6sen lassen, wie Sie Ihre Zeit und Energie konzentrieren k\u00f6nnen und wie Sie feststellen k\u00f6nnen, ob Ihre agile Praxis funktioniert. Der beste Weg, zu vermeiden, dass man etwas erstellt, das niemand m\u00f6chte, besteht darin, bei der Konzeption an jemanden zu denken. In der Designwelt nennen wir diesen \u201eJemand\u201c \u201ePersona\u201c. Personas und Problemszenarien (auch als \u201ezu erledigende Aufgaben\u201c bezeichnet) konzentrieren sich bei der Entwicklung darauf, ein n\u00fctzliches Ergebnis f\u00fcr Ihren Nutzer zu erzielen, anstatt nur eine Arbeitsleistung zu erbringen. In diesem Modul erfahren Sie, wie Sie Ihre Arbeit fokussieren, indem Sie unter Verwendung von bew\u00e4hrten Praktiken aus dem Design Thinking Personas, Problemszenarien und Alternativen entwickeln. Nach dem Entwurf von Personas und der hypothetischen Diskussion \u00fcber Nutzeranforderungen gehen wir zum Testen dieser Annahmen und zur Umsetzung des Gelernten in agile User Stories \u00fcber. Wir werden besprechen, wie Sie eine Interviewanleitung erstellen, um Ihren Nutzern die richtigen Fragen zu stellen. Anschlie\u00dfend werden wir uns detailliert mit agilen User Stories befassen. User Stories sind ein Standardmerkmal agilen Arbeitens und dienen als t\u00e4glicher Schwerpunkt f\u00fcr die Wertsteigerung. Die agile User Story ist Ihr t\u00e4glicher Schwerpunkt, um sicherzustellen, dass Sie etwas Wertsch\u00f6pfendes f\u00fcr Ihren Nutzer schaffen. Sie legt fest, wie Sie dies in Ihrem Team diskutieren und Ihre nachfolgenden Tests verankern. In diesem Modul erfahren Sie, wie Sie die Erstellung und Verwendung von Stories in Ihrem Team erleichtern.",

        "about": "Sound economic thinking is crucial for farmers because they depend on good economic decision making to survive. Governments depend on economic information to make good policy decisions on behalf of the community. This course will help you to contribute to better decision making by farmers, or by agencies servicing agriculture, and it will help you to understand why farmers respond to policies and economic opportunities in the ways they do. You can use this course to improve your skills and knowledge and to assess whether this is a subject that you'd like to study further. The course includes high-quality video lectures, interviews with experts, demonstrations of how to build economic models in spreadsheets, practice quizzes, and a range of recommended readings and optional readings. Assessment is by quizzes and a final exam. \n\nThe key economic principles that we\u2019ll learn about can help us understand changes that have occurred in agriculture, and support improved decision making about things like agricultural production methods, agricultural input levels, resource conservation, and the balance between agricultural production and its environmental impacts. \n\nThere are literally thousands of agricultural economists around the world who work on these issues, so there is a wealth of knowledge to draw on for the course.\n\nWatch a brief video about our course here: https://youtu.be/Y8OGswUXx48 Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish The University of Western Australia (UWA) was established in 1911 and continues to set the standard for other West Australian universities. Staff, students and graduates from the University have been recognised at state, national and international levels, and UWA continues to confirm its standing as one of Australia\u2019s leading research-intensive universities. UWA's leaders and researchers work in partnership with three domestic and international networks, the Group of Eight, Matariki and the Worldwide Universities Network. Week 1 provides a history of agricultural production and prices, an examination into the reasons behind changes in production and prices, and discussions of the 2007 global food crisis and agriculture\u2019s usage of resources.  Week 2 addresses the agricultural issues of water availability, peak phosphorus, herbicide resistance, and climate change. Week 3 looks at the relationship between inputs and outputs, the optimal level of an input, the question of pollution from inputs, and flat payoff functions. Week 4 focuses on evaluating land conservation practices, weighing benefits and costs correctly, non-economic factors, and provides an example in conservation agriculture. Week 5 discusses the importance of extending economics beyond the farm gate, characteristics of agri-environmental projects, Benefit: Cost Analysis, and provides an example with Gippsland Lakes. Week 6 ties up the course through discussion of government policies that support agriculture, policies that protect the rural environment, policies with problems, and justifications for agricultural policy.

        "about": "We all have to breathe to live. But the air we breathe is polluted both outdoors and indoors. Each year, this pollution costs 7 million lives across the globe \u2013 and a lot of suffering. 1 in 8 deaths is due to air pollution. This course will provide you with an introduction to the most recent research in the field of health effects of air pollution as well as a broader understanding of sources and spread of air pollution and what we should do about it.What is air pollution? What are the sources? How and where are we exposed outdoors and indoors? What happens in the body? Which diseases are the result? Who are the most vulnerable? How can we assess the effects of air pollution? And what should we do to reach the Sustainable Development Goal to \u201csubstantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution\u201d? These are some of the important questions we will address in the course.\n\nDuring the course you will meet researchers and experts from the University of Copenhagen and the Technical University of Denmark. They work with different aspects of air pollution and health: toxicology, exposure assessment, epidemiology, engineering and health impact assessment. It is a global responsibility to combat the health impacts of air pollution, and this fight can only be won through new knowledge and global collaboration. \n\nWe hope you will join us in the course and equip yourself to take part in this global and individual health challenge. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Portuguese (Brazilian), Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Portuguese (Brazilian), Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish The University of Copenhagen is the oldest University in Denmark - founded in 1479, and with over 38,000 students and more than 9,000 employees. The purpose of the University is to conduct research and provide education to the highest academic level. Based in Denmark's capital city it is one of the top research institutions in Europe.  The air we breathe is full of particles and gases. Some occur naturally, but many are the result of human activities. This first module will look into what air pollution is, where it comes from and what it does to our lungs and the rest of our body. Outdoor air pollution affects all of us \u2013 no matter where we are on the Globe. But there are big differences in air pollution levels from one country to another, from rural to urban areas, from city to city, and even from one side of the street to the other. Though all people are affected, some people are more vulnerable to the damaging health effects of air pollution than others. This module will explain about how we can study health effects of exposure to outdoor air pollution in diverse population groups.  We will also look at what we can do to fight outdoor pollution \u2013 and cope with it. Most people spend most of their time indoors. The building envelope traps and accumulates pollution from both indoor and outdoor sources. This module will explain about health effects of indoor use of solid fuel as a particularly important source in large parts of the world, as well as of other sources of indoor air pollution. You will also learn about what you can do to improve the air quality in your home.",

        "about": "Algebra is one of the definitive and oldest branches of mathematics, and design of computer algorithms is one of the youngest. Despite this generation gap, the two disciplines beautifully interweave. Firstly, modern computers would be somewhat useless if they were not able to carry out arithmetic and algebraic computations efficiently, so we need to think on dedicated, sometimes rather sophisticated algorithms for these operations. Secondly, algebraic structures and theorems can help develop algorithms for things having [at first glance] nothing to do with algebra, e.g. graph algorithms. One of the main goals of the offered course is thus providing the learners with the examples of the above mentioned situations. We believe the course to contain much material of interest to both CS and Math oriented students. The course is supported by programming assignments.

In this module we will study a mathematical model of hardware: the Boolean circuits. They provide the birds eye view of how one builds a complex logical circuit from elementary building blocks by linking them with wires. We will learn efficient ways to construct circuits for all four arithmetic operations on integers represented in binary form. Among other things we will see how to efficiently calculate all carries while adding two numbers (much faster than just computing these carries sequentially) and how Newton\u2019s approximation method for solving equations helps with implementing integer division. In this second and last module devoted to Boolean circuits we move from arithmetics to the problem of constructing efficient circuits for arbitrary Boolean functions. On the way, among other things, we will see how to estimate the number of trees via DFS traversals and how to construct efficiently a circuit that computes all functions of given small number of variables. Multiplication of integers is among the first things people learn to do with integers at school, later moving on to higher spheres: multiplying matrices, polynomials, permutations etc. Multiplication is one of the central things in algebra. This week we focus on classical algorithms for efficient integer multiplication first, and then move on to matrix and polynomial multiplication. On the way we will see how closely integer and polynomial multiplication are really intertwined and what polynomial interpolation has to do with multiplication. This module is the first one to feature application pf efficient algorithms for algebraic operations to something outside algebra. Currently we turn to distances in graphs. We also study a non-typical way of multiplying matrices motivated by applications to graph reachibiilty, namely, Boolean matrix multiplication, and consider a corresponding rather general speedup technique. This week we first learn how to compute determinant and invert a matrix on a parallel computer, and how working with seemingly \u201ccomputationally inconvenient\u201d infinite series helps deriving quite a efficient formulas for the determinant. The second part of this module is devoted to a more common single-threaded computational model and there we prove that essentially the complexity of inverting a matrix is the same as that of matrix multiplication. In the last module of the course we learn some tools for efficient use of randomization and algebra in algorithm design and use our knowledge about the existence of fast algorithms for parallel determinant computation to find perfect matchings in bipartite graphs unbelievably quickly on parallel computers.",

Established in 1992 to promote new research and teaching in economics and related disciplines, it now offers programs at all levels of university education across an extraordinary range of fields of study including business, sociology, cultural studies, philosophy, political science, international relations, law, Asian studies, media and communicamathematics, engineering, and more.Learn more on www.hse.ru Welcome to the first module of Data Structures and Algorithms! Here we will provide an overview of where algorithms and data structures are used (hint: everywhere) and walk you through a few sample programming challenges. The programming challenges represent an important (and often the most difficult!) part of this specialization because the only way to fully understand an algorithm is to implement it. Writing correct and efficient programs is hard; please don\u2019t be surprised if they don\u2019t work as you planned\u2014our first programs did not work either! We will help you on your journey through the specialization by showing how to implement your first programming challenges. We will also introduce testing techniques that will help increase your chances of passing assignments on your first attempt. In case your program does not work as intended, we will show how to fix it, even if you don\u2019t yet know which test your implementation is failing on. In this module you will learn that programs based on efficient algorithms can solve the same problem billions of times faster than programs based on na\u00efve algorithms. You will learn how to estimate the running time and memory of an algorithm without even implementing it. Armed with this knowledge, you will be able to compare various algorithms, select the most efficient ones, and finally implement them as our programming challenges! In this module you will learn about seemingly na\u00efve yet powerful class of algorithms called greedy algorithms. After you will learn the key idea behind the greedy algorithms, you may feel that they represent the algorithmic Swiss army knife that can be applied to solve nearly all programming challenges in this course. But be warned: with a few exceptions that we will cover, this intuitive idea rarely works in practice! For this reason, it is important to prove that a greedy algorithm always produces an optimal solution before using this algorithm. In the end of this module, we will test your intuition and taste for greedy algorithms by offering several programming challenges. In this module you will learn about a powerful algorithmic technique called Divide and Conquer. Based on this technique, you will see how to search huge databases millions of times faster than using na\u00efve linear search. You will even learn that the standard way to multiply numbers (that you learned in the grade school) is far from the being the fastest! We will then apply the divide-and-conquer technique to design two efficient algorithms (merge sort and quick sort) for sorting huge lists, a problem that finds many applications in practice. Finally, we will show that these two algorithms are optimal, that is, no algorithm can sort faster! In this final module of the course you will learn about the powerful algorithmic technique for solving many optimization problems called Dynamic Programming. It turned out that dynamic programming can solve many problems that evade all attempts to solve them using greedy or divide-and-conquer strategy. There are countless applications of dynamic programming in practice: from maximizing the advertisement revenue of a TV station, to search for similar Internet pages, to gene finding (the problem where biologists need to find the minimum number of mutations to transform one gene into another). You will learn how the same idea helps to automatically make spelling corrections and to show the differences between two versions of the same text.  In this module, we continue practicing implementing dynamic programming solutions. This specialization is a mix of theory and practice: you will learn algorithmic techniques for solving various computational problems and will implement about 100 algorithmic coding problems in a programming language of your choice. No other online course in Algorithms even comes close to offering you a wealth of programming challenges that you may face at your next job interview. To prepare you, we invested over 3000 hours into designing our challenges as an alternative to multiple choice questions that you usually find in MOOCs. Sorry, we do not believe in multiple choice questions when it comes to learning algorithms...or anything else in computer science! For each algorithm you develop and implement, we designed multiple tests to check its correctness and running time \u2014 you will have to debug your programs without even knowing what these tests are! It may sound difficult, but we believe it is the only way to truly understand how the algorithms work and to master the art of programming. The specialization contains two real-world projects: Big Networks and Genome Assembly. You will analyze both road networks and social networks and will learn how to compute the shortest route between New York and San Francisco (1000 times faster than the standard shortest path algorithms!) Afterwards, you will learn how to assemble genomes from millions of short fragments of DNA and how assembly algorithms fuel recent developments in personalized medicine.",

In this module, you will learn ways to represent a graph as well as basic algorithms for decomposing graphs into parts. In the programming assignment of this module, you will apply the algorithms that you\u2019ve learned to implement efficient programs for exploring mazes, analyzing Computer Science curriculum, and analyzing road networks. In the first week of the module, we focus on undirected graphs. This week we continue to study graph decomposition algorithms, but now for directed graphs. In this module you will study algorithms for finding Shortest Paths in Graphs. These algorithms have lots of applications. When you launch a navigation app on your smartphone like Google Maps or Yandex.Navi, it uses these algorithms to find you the fastest route from work to home, from home to school, etc. When you search for airplane tickets, these algorithms are used to find a route with the minimum number of plane changes. Unexpectedly, these algorithms can also be used to determine the optimal way to do currency exchange, sometimes allowing to earh huge profit! We will cover all these applications, and you will learn Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm and Bellman-Ford Algorithm. These algorithms are efficient and lay the foundation for even more efficient algorithms which you will learn and implement in the Shortest Paths Capstone Project to find best routes on real maps of cities and countries, find distances between people in Social Networks. In the end you will be able to find Shortest Paths efficiently in any Graph. This week we will study Breadth-First Search algorithm. This week we continue to study Shortest Paths in Graphs. You will learn Dijkstra's Algorithm which can be applied to find the shortest route home from work. You will also learn Bellman-Ford's algorithm which can unexpectedly be applied to choose the optimal way of exchanging currencies. By the end you will be able to find shortest paths efficiently in any Graph. In this module, we study the minimum spanning tree problem. We will cover two elegant greedy algorithms for this problem: the first one is due to Kruskal and uses the disjoint sets data structure, the second one is due to Prim and uses the priority queue data structure. In the programming assignment for this module you will be computing an optimal way of building roads between cities and an optimal way of partitioning a given set of objects into clusters (a fundamental problem in data mining). In this module, you will learn Advanced Shortest Paths algorithms that work in practice 1000s (up to 25000) of times faster than the classical Dijkstra's algorithm on real-world road networks and social networks graphs. You will work on a Programming Project based on these algorithms. You will find the shortest paths on the real maps of parts of US and the shortest paths connecting people in the social networks. We encourage you not only to use the ideas from this module's lectures in your implementations, but also to come up with your own ideas for speeding up the algorithm! We encourage you to compete on the forums to see whose implementation is the fastest one :) This specialization is a mix of theory and practice: you will learn algorithmic techniques for solving various computational problems and will implement about 100 algorithmic coding problems in a programming language of your choice. No other online course in Algorithms even comes close to offering you a wealth of programming challenges that you may face at your next job interview. To prepare you, we invested over 3000 hours into designing our challenges as an alternative to multiple choice questions that you usually find in MOOCs. Sorry, we do not believe in multiple choice questions when it comes to learning algorithms...or anything else in computer science! For each algorithm you develop and implement, we designed multiple tests to check its correctness and running time \u2014 you will have to debug your programs without even knowing what these tests are! It may sound difficult, but we believe it is the only way to truly understand how the algorithms work and to master the art of programming. The specialization contains two real-world projects: Big Networks and Genome Assembly. You will analyze both road networks and social networks and will learn how to compute the shortest route between New York and San Francisco (1000 times faster than the standard shortest path algorithms!) Afterwards, you will learn how to assemble genomes from millions of short fragments of DNA and how assembly algorithms fuel recent developments in personalized medicine.",

In 1973, Peter Weiner came up with a surprising solution that was based on suffix trees, the key data structure in pattern matching.  Computer scientists were so impressed with his algorithm that they called it the Algorithm of the Year.  In this lesson, we will explore some key ideas for pattern matching that will - through a series of trials and errors - bring us to suffix trees. Although EXACT pattern matching with suffix trees is fast, it is not clear how to use suffix trees for APPROXIMATE pattern matching.  In 1994, Michael Burrows and David Wheeler invented an ingenious algorithm for text compression that is now known as Burrows-Wheeler Transform. They knew nothing about genomics, and they could not have imagined that 15 years later their algorithm will become the workhorse of biologists searching for genomic mutations. But what text compression has to do with pattern matching??? In this lesson you will learn that the fate of an algorithm is often hard to predict \u2013 its applications may appear in a field that has nothing to do with the original plan of its inventors. Congratulations, you have now learned the key pattern matching concepts: tries, suffix trees, suffix arrays and even the Burrows-Wheeler transform! However, some of the results Pavel mentioned remain mysterious: e.g., how can we perform exact pattern matching in O(|Text|) time rather than in O(|Text|*|Pattern|) time as in the na\u00efve brute force algorithm? How can it be that matching a 1000-nucleotide pattern against the human genome is nearly as fast as matching a 3-nucleotide pattern??? Also, even though Pavel showed how to quickly construct the suffix array given the suffix tree, he has not revealed the magic behind the fast algorithms for the suffix tree construction!In this module, Mi\u0441hael will address some algorithmic challenges that Pavel tried to hide from you :) such as the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for exact pattern matching and more efficient algorithms for suffix tree and suffix array construction. In this module we continue studying algorithmic challenges of the string algorithms. You will learn an O(n log n) algorithm for suffix array construction and a linear time algorithm for construction of suffix tree from a suffix array. You will also implement these algorithms and the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm in the last Programming Assignment in this course.

It is one of the eight universities of the Ivy League, and one of the nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution. Welcome to Algorithms, Part I. We illustrate our basic approach to developing and analyzing algorithms by considering the dynamic connectivity problem. We introduce the union\u2212find data type and consider several implementations (quick find, quick union, weighted quick union, and weighted quick union with path compression). Finally, we apply the union\u2212find data type to the percolation problem from physical chemistry. The basis of our approach for analyzing the performance of algorithms is the scientific method. We begin by performing computational experiments to measure the running times of our programs. We use these measurements to develop hypotheses about performance. Next, we create mathematical models to explain their behavior. Finally, we consider analyzing the memory usage of our Java programs. We consider two fundamental data types for storing collections of objects: the stack and the queue. We implement each using either a singly-linked list or a resizing array. We introduce two advanced Java features\u2014generics and iterators\u2014that simplify client code. Finally, we consider various applications of stacks and queues ranging from parsing arithmetic expressions to simulating queueing systems. We introduce the sorting problem and Java's Comparable interface. We study two elementary sorting methods (selection sort and insertion sort) and a variation of one of them (shellsort). We also consider two algorithms for uniformly shuffling an array. We conclude with an application of sorting to computing the convex hull via the Graham scan algorithm. We study the mergesort algorithm and show that it guarantees to sort any array of n items with at most n lg n compares. We also consider a nonrecursive, bottom-up version. We prove that any compare-based sorting algorithm must make at least  n lg n compares in the worst case. We discuss using different orderings for the objects that we are sorting and the related concept of stability. We introduce and implement the randomized quicksort algorithm and analyze its performance. We also consider randomized quickselect, a quicksort variant which finds the kth smallest item in linear time. Finally, we consider 3-way quicksort, a variant of quicksort that works especially well in the presence of duplicate keys. We introduce the priority queue data type and an efficient implementation using the binary heap data structure. This implementation also leads to an efficient sorting algorithm known as heapsort. We conclude with an applications of priority queues where we simulate the motion of n particles subject to the laws of elastic collision.  We define an API for symbol tables (also known as associative arrays, maps, or dictionaries) and describe two elementary implementations using a sorted array (binary search) and an unordered list (sequential search). When the keys are Comparable, we define an extended API that includes the additional methods min, max floor, ceiling, rank, and select. To develop an efficient implementation of this API, we study the binary search tree data structure and analyze its performance. In this lecture, our goal is to develop a symbol table with guaranteed logarithmic performance for search and insert (and many other operations). We begin with 2\u22123 trees, which are easy to analyze but hard to implement. Next, we consider red\u2212black binary search trees, which we view as a novel way to implement 2\u22123 trees as binary search trees. Finally, we introduce B-trees, a generalization of 2\u22123 trees that are widely used to implement file systems. We start with 1d and 2d range searching, where the goal is to find all points in a given 1d or 2d interval. To accomplish this, we consider kd-trees, a natural generalization of BSTs when the keys are points in the plane (or higher dimensions). We also consider intersection problems, where the goal is to find all intersections among a set of line segments or rectangles. We begin by describing the desirable properties of hash function and how to implement them in Java, including a fundamental tenet known as the uniform hashing assumption that underlies the potential success of a hashing application. Then, we consider two strategies for implementing hash tables\u2014separate chaining and linear probing. Both strategies yield constant-time performance for search and insert under the uniform hashing assumption.  We consider various applications of symbol tables including sets, dictionary clients, indexing clients, and sparse vectors.",

It is one of the eight universities of the Ivy League, and one of the nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution. Welcome to Algorithms, Part II. We define an undirected graph API and consider the adjacency-matrix and adjacency-lists representations. We introduce two classic algorithms for searching a graph\u2014depth-first search and breadth-first search. We also consider the problem of computing connected components and conclude with related problems and applications. In this lecture we study directed graphs. We begin with depth-first search and breadth-first search in digraphs and describe applications ranging from garbage collection to web crawling. Next, we introduce a depth-first search based algorithm for computing the topological order of an acyclic digraph. Finally, we implement the Kosaraju\u2212Sharir algorithm for computing the strong components of a digraph. In this lecture we study the minimum spanning tree problem. We begin by considering a generic greedy algorithm for the problem. Next, we consider and implement two classic algorithm for the problem\u2014Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm. We conclude with some applications and open problems. In this lecture we study shortest-paths problems. We begin by analyzing some basic properties of shortest paths and a generic algorithm for the problem. We introduce and analyze Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest-paths problems with nonnegative weights. Next, we consider an even faster algorithm for DAGs, which works even if the weights are negative. We conclude with the Bellman\u2212Ford\u2212Moore algorithm for edge-weighted digraphs with no negative cycles. We also consider applications ranging from content-aware fill to arbitrage. In this lecture we introduce the maximum flow and minimum cut problems. We begin with the Ford\u2212Fulkerson algorithm. To analyze its correctness, we establish the maxflow\u2212mincut theorem. Next, we consider an efficient implementation of the Ford\u2212Fulkerson algorithm, using the shortest augmenting path rule. Finally, we consider applications, including bipartite matching and baseball elimination. In this lecture we consider specialized sorting algorithms for strings and related objects. We begin with a subroutine to sort integers in a small range. We then consider two classic radix sorting algorithms\u2014LSD and MSD radix sorts. Next, we consider an especially efficient variant, which is a hybrid of MSD radix sort and quicksort known as 3-way radix quicksort. We conclude with suffix sorting and related applications. In this lecture we consider specialized algorithms for symbol tables with string keys. Our goal is a data structure that is as fast as hashing and even more flexible than binary search trees. We begin with multiway tries; next we consider ternary search tries. Finally, we consider character-based operations, including prefix match and longest prefix, and related applications. In this lecture we consider algorithms for searching for a substring in a piece of text. We begin with a brute-force algorithm, whose running time is quadratic in the worst case. Next, we consider the ingenious Knuth\u2212Morris\u2212Pratt algorithm whose running time is guaranteed to be linear in the worst case. Then, we introduce the Boyer\u2212Moore algorithm, whose running time is sublinear on typical inputs. Finally, we consider the Rabin\u2212Karp fingerprint algorithm, which uses hashing in a clever way to solve the substring search and related problems. A regular expression is a method for specifying a set of strings. Our topic for this lecture is the famous grep algorithm that determines whether a given text contains any substring from the set. We examine an efficient implementation that makes use of our digraph reachability implementation from Week 1. We study and implement several classic data compression schemes, including run-length coding, Huffman compression, and LZW compression. We develop efficient implementations from first principles using a Java library for manipulating binary data that we developed for this purpose, based on priority queue and symbol table implementations from earlier lectures. Our lectures this week are centered on the idea of problem-solving models like maxflow and shortest path, where a new problem can be formulated as an instance of one of those problems, and then solved with a classic and efficient algorithm. To complete the course, we describe the classic unsolved problem from theoretical computer science that is centered on the concept of algorithm efficiency and guides us in the search for efficient solutions to difficult problems.  The quintessential problem-solving model is known as linear programming, and the simplex method for solving it is one of the most widely used algorithms. In this lecture, we given an overview of this central topic in operations research and describe its relationship to algorithms that we have considered. Is there a universal problem-solving model to which all problems that we would like to solve reduce and for which we know an efficient algorithm? You may be surprised to learn that we do no know the answer to this question. In this lecture we introduce the complexity classes P, NP, and NP-complete, pose the famous P = NP question, and consider implications in the context of algorithms that we have treated in this course.",

Established in 1853, it is Australia's second oldest University. This week we will define a statistical measure of stand-alone risk as being the standard deviation of returns. We will describe three alternative attitudes towards risk, settling on risk aversion as being the standard assumption made in financial markets. We will then analyse the impact of combining assets into a portfolio upon both risk and return and then quantify the benefits from diversification by comparing performance against a suitable benchmark. This week we differentiate between systematic and unsystematic risk and explain how the expected returns that are reflected in the prices of assets should be linked to only one type of risk. We illustrate how the Capital Asset Pricing Model might be used to link systematic risk with expected return and then discuss the empirical shortcomings of the model. This leads to a description of more advanced models and we conclude with a review of survey evidence that considers the approach taken by finance mangers of large listed firms in practice.  This week we will explain the logical underpinnings of the Weighted Average Cost of Capital Formula and show how it might be estimated in practice by a firm. We will also consider the many challenges that might be faced in using this approach to estimating hurdle rates and conclude with a warning about the perverse outcomes that might occur if the technique is used in a haphazard manner. This week we describe how standard NPV analysis might lead to incorrect decisions when we fail to account for the impact of (or upon) firm flexibility. We then describe the three most common types of real options that firms face in practice and then explain how decision trees might be used to arrive at an approximation of the value of the real option that is embedded within a project. We conclude by considering empirical evidence on the take-up of real options analysis and discuss the situations in which real options analysis might most be needed.  You will gain a firm understanding of corporate finance, including accounting principles and financial analysis, how value is created by global markets, the choices firms face when making financial decisions and defining attitudes towards risk.

Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Chinese (Simplified), Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Chinese (Simplified), Russian, English, Spanish For more than 300 years, Yale University has inspired the minds that inspire the world. Based in New Haven, Connecticut, Yale brings people and ideas together for positive impact around the globe. A research university that focuses on students and encourages learning as an essential way of life, Yale is a place for connection, creativity, and innovation among cultures and across disciplines.  Hello everyone and welcome to America\u2019s Unwritten Constitution!  This course is designed to teach you some of the basic tool and techniques for constitutional interpretation.  Over the next 13 modules, Professor Akhil Amar will teach you how to go beyond the text of the U.S. Constitution, while still remaining faithful to it. Please, take some time to watch the two introductory videos and read through some of the course information below. Enjoy! Heeding the Deed, refers to the technique of understanding the Constitution further by looking at issues the nation was dealing with at the time of the passage's adoption. Another way to say this could be; putting yourself in the framer's shoes.  This module teaches the interpretive technique of reading between the lines. This involves extracting, from the text, things that are implicit, but not expressly stated.  In this module, we explore a number of unenumerated rights that exist simply because Americans embody these rights in their everyday lives. Owning pets, using contraception, testifying at one\u2019s own trial, none of these are explicitly mentioned in the text of the Constitution, yet today, they are recognized as protected fundamental rights. Professor Amar explains why. The \"Confronting Modern Case Law\" lectures take a closer look at the Warren-lead Supreme Court.  Spanning from 1953 to 1969, his court decided many of the most influential cases is U.S. history. Brown v. Board of Education, Miranda v. Arizona, Griswold v. Connecticut to name a few. Professor Amar, will discuss how the court arrived at their decisions, how these rulings changed American society at the time and how they are still affecting it today. Professor Amar discusses the role that precedent\u2014that is, prior court decisions\u2014plays in our understanding of the document. He will answer questions about how far courts should go when interpreting the Constitution, and what courts might do when they believe that a prior decision was incorrect. Here we'll examine documents outside of the Constitution that influence our understanding of the founding text\u2014things like the Declaration of Independence, The Federalist papers, Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address, and Martin Luther King\u2019s I Have a Dream speech. Professor Amar will explain how these sources have offered meaning and guidance in constitutional interpretation. These lectures explore the profound changes American society underwent immediately following the  ratification of the 19th amendment. The reverberations of women's enfranchisement are still being strongly felt today. Prof. Amar will highlight some legislation, he believes, directly or indirectly owe their existence to the 19th amendment. Undoubtedly, the figure who looms largest in U.S. political history is George Washington. His actions before, during, and after the Presidency set precedents for the executive office which are still observed today.  Prof. Amar will explain why Article II of the Constitution was custom written for our first president.  This module delves into how the actual structure of each government branch inherently effects their interactions with one another. The framers purposefully under-specified sections of the Constitution, leaving room for flexibility. They rightly assumed future law makers would fill these \u201cgaps\u201d in procedure as need arose. Indeed they have, each time a gap is discovered and bridged, a new precedent is set. Professor Amar will highlight several examples of these powers-set-by-precendent, for each branch of government In this module, Prof. Amar chronicles the adoption and evolution of the two party system in America. You'll learn which framers founded each party and how the creation of the parties caused great friction in government. The lectures go on to explain how the Constitution changed to accommodate the two party system and how these changes have made to the two party system inextricably codified into the Document.  This module discusses the role of conscience in government. It is important for us to remember, the Constitution did not implement itself. It was implemented by human beings with minds, hearts, and consciences. Understanding the interaction between these \u201chuman elements\u201d and the text is fundamental to proper interpretation of the Constitution. We\u2019ll go over several codified manifestations of the \"human element\" in the Constitution, such as the veto and juror nullification.  In the course\u2019s final lectures, we\u2019ll look to the future and ask, \"what will the constitution look like in 25 years? 50 years? 100?\" Might we soon see an amendment allowing for a foreign born president? Or the dissolution of the Electoral College? Prof. Amar will discuss the idea of \"constitutional  trajectory,\" and the factors which affect it.  We\u2019ll go over how today\u2019s legislators can be looked at as \"framers of the future.\u201d Which will lead to the very interesting topic of \u201csunrise legislation.\" This content is not tied to the assessment materials in any way but it is interesting, entertaining, and informative nonetheless. We encourage all learners to take some time to watch these videos and post about them in the discussion forums!  Prof. Amar recapitulate concepts learned in this course and discuss his hopes for you all; the matriculants of America\u2019s Unwritten Constitution. We sincerely hope you all have enjoyed the course and learned something along the way! Thank you so much for your time and effort.",

Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish For more than 300 years, Yale University has inspired the minds that inspire the world.

A research university that focuses on students and encourages learning as an essential way of life, Yale is a place for connection, creativity, and innovation among cultures and across disciplines.  This first module will help you get your bearings before diving into America's Written Constitution. You can watch a brief introduction to the course, learn about quizzes and writing assignments, and find out what you can look forward to learning. This section also provides you with a copy of The Document itself. There is no need to read through it right away, Our hope is that you will follow along as Prof. Amar works his ways through it over the course of the next 14 modules. Good luck, and we hope you enjoy the experience!  Ready to get started? Good. In this module, you'll take a guided tour of the Preamble and learn how one sentence changed the world.  In this module you will learn how geography, democracy, wealth, and race affected the structure of our legislative branch. Prof. Amar will explain the underlying factors behind decisions on Senatorial term limits, age qualifications, salaries and much more.   This entire module is devoted to just one section of one article of the U.S. constitution.  It is the longest, and arguably, most important section of The Document. Article 1, Section 8, enumerates the powers held by Congress. Join Professor Amar, as he discusses the implications of these powers, including regulation of trade, creation of an army and navy, and the levying of taxes.  In this module you'll find out what about George Washington made him so uniquely qualified for the task of being our nation's first president. Learn how his actions before, during, and after his time in office set precedents which are still followed today.  As the title of this module suggests, you will be hearing about the specific powers held by the President of the United States. Learn how the presidential pardon is directly related to national security and why the veto power is nearly insurmountable. Prof. Amar will also point out how in a small number of situations, the President of the United States is even more powerful than the King of England. The judicial branch of the U.S. today only vaguely resembles what framers had in mind. In this section you'll learn you about the decisions the men behind the judicial branch's expansion in power and in scale.  Article 4 of the Constitution outlines the interrelationship between States and territories. In order for this emerging country to succeed, the framers knew states would need to start thinking of themselves as parts of the same whole.  To achieve this, rules needed to be set in place for interstate trade and travel. Prof. Amar will introduce the concept of Horizontal Federalism, looking specifically at how the Constitution accounts for the differences between state laws on slavery and voting rights. Finally you'll learn about the Taney-led Supreme Court, whose rulings on racial laws would help set America down the path to civil war. What's the difference between a treaty and a statute? Which takes precedent? In this module Prof. Amar takes you through article 7 of the Constitution. Along the way you'll learn the difference between laws, treaties, resolutions, and statutes. Learn how each one comes into being and how the inherent democracy of each determines their place in the hierarchy. Anti-Federalists, rejoice! This module's lectures go over the first ten amendments to America's constitution, also known as the Bill of Rights. These amendments contain some of the most iconic language contained in The Document. Freedom of Speech, the right to keep and bare arms, the right to a fair trial, all this can be found in the Bill of Rights. Prof. Amar will go over where the framers borrowed the ideas for these amendments, and also who championed and opposed their adoption.  This module, as we move forward both in text and in time. After the first 12 amendments to the constitution, 50 quiescent years pass before three new amendments are ratified in rapid succession. The 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution brought radical change to America by abolishing slavery, redefining citizenship, and expanding voting rights.  What event could possibly spur such significant legislative action? Get ready as Professor Amar guides us through a wholly singular look at America's Civil War.  You may have noticed by now that amendments to the U.S. Constitution come in waves. In module 13 Professor Amar will go over the third wave to break. Amendments 16-19 made America's version of democracy more direct and more universal than ever before. The addition of women to the voting pool forever altered America's political course. Eventually leading to the passage of socially conscious policies such as the New Deal, the Great Society, and Obamacare.  The surging Civil Right's Movement of the 1960's along with wars both cold and hot, made the political environment in the U.S. ripe for change. Prof. Amar explains out how amendments 23-26 continued making the United States' brand of democracy more universal and more egalitarian. After briefly covering the 27th Amendment, a question is posed to you, the learner: What do you think the next amendment to the Constitution should be?  This content is not tied to the assessment materials in any way, but it is interesting, entertaining and informative nonetheless. We encourage all learners to take some time to watch these videos and post about them in the discussion forums! Professor Amar hopes you will continue your journey through the U.S. Constitution by going beneath, beyond, and behind the text in AWC's sister course America's Unwritten Constitution.  You'll learn of the traditions, court decisions, popular values, and precedents that compliment the text and complete The Document. ",

        "about": "This course will give you a glimpse into six different areas of American law: Tort Law, Contract Law, Property, Constitutional Law, Criminal Law, and Civil Procedure. You will gain insight into the complexities and dilemmas that arise from the application of law in different settings, and what is distinctive about American approaches. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish The University of Pennsylvania (commonly referred to as Penn) is a private university, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. A member of the Ivy League, Penn is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, and considers itself to be the first university in the United States with both undergraduate and graduate studies.   Tort law governs how people may sue each other civilly (as opposed to criminally) in order to receive compensation for harms or injuries other people caused them. In this module, Professor Allen will explore the goals of tort law through a historic case. She will address what makes tort law distinct and issues surrounding negligence and liability. Contract law governs how promises between two individuals are enforced. Few areas of law impact our daily lives as much as contract law, and in this module you will gain a deeper understanding of what a contract is and what makes it enforceable. Professor Wilkinson-Ryan will address what constitutes a contract, why the law enforces them, the legal meanings of words in contracts, and the important requirement of consideration. Expectation damages, or the amount a court orders someone who breached a contract to pay will also be explored, all through hypothetical and real cases. Property law governs the relationship between individuals and things, known as property. In this module, Professor Balganesh will explore the differences between property and tort and contract law and about several specific examples of property law in action: adverse possession, landlord/tenant, and licenses. You will learn about what makes U.S. property law distinct - its origins in common law, imprint of legal realism, and pragmatism. The study of constitutional law is among the most exciting parts of the law because it provides for the structure and functioning of the U.S. government. In this module, Dean Ruger will address the document itself, how it has been applied over time, the history of the document, and what makes it unique. The structure of  the U.S. government as a government of limited, separated powers will be explored along with the important individual rights the Constitution provides and how the U.S. Constitution compares to others around the world.  In this module, Professor Morse will focus on the basics of criminal law, an area of law so exciting that countless TV shows and movies have been based on it. The major aspects of criminal law will be discussed - why we impose punishment, when we impose the most punishment, and how the state proves a criminal case. Defenses to criminal charges, which are divided into justifications and excuses will also be addressed. In this module, Professor Wolff will introduce us to some of the major issues in civil procedure law. Civil procedure is the study of the rules of court that must be followed by the judge and parties in civil cases (as opposed to criminal cases \u2013 criminal procedure is a whole other area of the law, but law students learn civil procedure first because it gives the structure of typical trials). The essence of a law school civil procedure course is the study of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. A copy of these is linked in the syllabus for you to scan. The rules tell you how to file a lawsuit and how the court must function while it is considering a lawsuit. Professor Wolff will introduce you to the doctrinal area of procedure and will highlight some of the major modern issues in procedure law. ",

        "about": "How do we make decisions as consumers? What do we pay attention to, and how do our initial responses predict our final choices? To what extent are these processes unconscious and cannot be reflected in overt reports? This course will provide you with an introduction to some of the most basic methods in the emerging fields of consumer neuroscience and neuromarketing. You will learn about the methods employed and what they mean. You will learn about the basic brain mechanisms in consumer choice, and how to stay updated on these topics. The course will give an overview of the current and future uses of neuroscience in business. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Centrally located in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, Copenhagen Business School (CBS) is one of the largest business schools in Europe with close to 23,000 students. CBS offers world-class research-based degree programs at undergraduate, graduate, and PhD levels as well as executive and other post experience programs. We first need to define the field \u2013 what are the key concepts, what are the key methods and reasons for employing neuroscience to study consumers and communication effects? In this module, we will introduce the topic and how some specific studies provide key insights into what neuroscience has to offer in relationship with more traditional methods. In the second module of this course we are turning to the functions of the brain, and we will first focus on attention and consciousness. This module will focus on some key concepts in attention and consciousness. In this module we will have contents filled on the topic of sensory neuromarketing. How are our senses affected differently as consumers? What can you do to organise your communications to better use all the senses? How does the brain actually use the senses? What tools do we have for assessing the use of senses, and how they affect consumers? In this module, everything is about emotions and feelings, and the relationship between emotions and preference.As we will see, our minds have a dual side: a conscious and an unconscious response and motivation, which are crucial to understanding consumer preference and choice. Indeed, unconscious emotional responses may turn out to be driving consumer choice to the same - or even larger - degree than conscious feelings. Are conscious feelings a mere after-the-fact rationalization upon conscious choice? This module will focus on Learning & Memory. We will determine not only that there are multiple kinds of memory, but that they also serve multiple purposes. If anything, learning is the vehicle we need to understand the most in consumer behaviour. What causes memory, and can we be affected unconsciously by our memories? How can we measure memory effects, and what is the relationship between brand equity and the brain?This module, we also have an interview with Prof. Richard Silberstein, who shares his view on neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience. Prof. Silberstein is the Founder and chairman of the neuromarketing company Neuro-Insight (http://www.neuro-insight.com/). This module, we will focus on both the ethics of neuromarketing, as well as aberrant consumer behaviours. We see that consumer choice can sometimes become the centre focus on a person's life, be it pathological gambling, \"shopaholism\" or digital dependencies. This module, we will focus on some of these issues, and combine them with the ethical aspects that we face when talking neuro. This module we also end off with two interviews: one with Prof. Jan Trzaskowksi at the CBS, who is working on marketing and the law, where we discuss what the ethical and legal aspects of neuromarketing is. As you will see, Jan has a very particular take on this that I am sure you will find interesting. Our second interview is with Carl Marci, who is the Co-Founder and Chief Science Officer of Innerscope Research (http://innerscoperesearch.com/) on his background and their take on neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience.",

The purpose of the University is to conduct research and provide education to the highest academic level. Based in Denmark's capital city it is one of the top research institutions in Europe.  Welcome to the first module of this global health course. In the first lesson we will introduce you to the overall concepts and definitions of global health and examine the question \"What are the biggest global health challenges?\". You'll get to hear some answers from fellow learners from around the world, and also have an opportunity to join the conversation here in the course discussion forums. We also have an interview with Professor Susan Whyte about the impact of health policy on a population's health. The second lesson deals with the central tools needed to measure global health burden. Together these two lessons will form the basis on which all the other topical modules are built. Enjoy! The second module of this course is focussed on infectious diseases. Lesson 3 will introduce you to the concept of infectious diseases and their relation to poverty and development, and lesson 4 will go through three prominent examples of infectious diseases that are still unfinished agendas in large parts of the world. In the third module we'll have a closer look at non-communicable diseases, in short NCDs, and examine the forces that are behind the global epidemic rise of NCDs such as diabetes. The module also includes a lesson about mental health and injuries - two major global health challenges that are often ignored when dealing with NCDs.  This fourth module deals with maternal and child health. The first focus will be on the important, and at times controversial, topic of sexual and reproductive health and rights, often shortened to SRHR. This is followed by a short lesson focussed on child health.  In the fifth module we are looking at some great global crises that profoundly impact the health of populations, namely environment, climate change, and migration. We will examine the health acpect of these mega trends - how are they influencing and challenging policy, health systems, and the health of individuals in both low and high income countries? Access to nutrituous food and clean water are fundamental to health and wellbeing. In the sixth module we are focussing on the role of nutrition and water, with some extra attention to the important role of sanitation and hygiene and their relation to human development.  In this final module of the course we will go full circle, with lessons about the role of health systems and the impact of policy. The last lesson of the course will focus on global health governance and the health aspects of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. ",

Along the way, it intersects with aspects of public health, equity and the environment. In this course, we will provide a brief introduction to the U.S. food system and how food production practices and what we choose to eat impacts the world in which we live. We will discuss some key historical and political factors that have helped shape the current food system and consider alternative approaches from farm to fork. The course will be led by a team of faculty and staff from the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future. Guest lecturers will include experts from a variety of disciplines, including public health, policy and agriculture. Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish The mission of The Johns Hopkins University is to educate its students and cultivate their capacity for life-long learning, to foster independent and original research, and to bring the benefits of discovery to the world. Welcome to our short course on the U.S. food system. In this first series of lectures, we dig into the very important concepts of food systems, food security and intergenerational equity and begin to explore what we eat, how that food is produced, and how our dietary choices impact our health and the health of the planet.  This broad overview lecture lays the foundation for the rest of the course.  This lesson expands on the concepts of food system sustainability and resilience, and describes strategies that could dramatically improve the food system and the ability of future generations to feed themselves. The 1938 USDA Yearbook of Agriculture stated, \u201cEssentially, all life depends upon the soil ... There can be no life without soil and no soil without life; they have evolved together\u201d.  In this module, we will take a very brief look at the importance of methods of food production for sustainability, resilience, food security and health. We will now examine the livestock and seafood industries, which we have touched on in previous modules as a key driver of the global food system. As incomes rise around the world, so too does the global collective appetite for meat. Some of our greatest challenges and debates of the 21st century are rooted in the rising demand for animal protein in an era of dwindling resources and climate change. NOTE:  This lecture refers to other lectures offered in this or related full for-credit courses at the Bloomberg School of Public Health.   In the next set of lectures, we begin to explore food and farm policy, a huge and complex topic.  Roni Neff returns with an overview of the history and content of the current  farm bill and why it really should be called a \u2018food bill\u2019, considering the magnitude of its impact on public health.  Then Mark Winne will share his experiences as an advocate for community food security and regional food systems here in the U.S. For those of you interested in the international perspective of food policy, we have provided in the readings list a link to a terrific talk by Olivier deSchutter, the former UN special rapporteur on the Right to Food.   In this final module of the course you will hear from real people working to build a healthier, more sustainable food system. First, Michael Heller of Clagett Farm in Maryland will share his farming philosophy and how he links his farm to the local community near Washington DC.  Then you\u2019ll hear about Meatless Monday as an example of using health communication campaigns to change the food system from the demand-side. The optional Honors lesson includes two short films produced by CLF showcasing projects and people around the U.S. that are improving the food system from field to plate.  ",

Made up of seven faculties covering approximately 100 different subject areas, UZH is proud to offer the most comprehensive aca\u00addemic program in the country. In this module we will learn about probabilities and perform our first calculations using probability formulas. We want to get comfortable with the idea that probabilities describe the chance of uncertain events occurring. The arrival of new information may lead us to alter our probabilistic assessments of uncertain events. In this module, we will learn how the concept of \"conditional\" probabilities allows us to make these changes correctly. Script of the course can be found here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/introductiontoprobability/resources/qxi9W  We will discuss some fascinating every-day applications of probability. In addition to entertaining examples, we will also review very serious applications from finance and law. In this module we move beyond probabilities and learn about important summary measures such as expected values, variances, and standard deviations. We also learn about the most popular discrete probability distribution, the binomial distribution. We want to get comfortable with the normal distribution. We will discuss what the famous bell curve really represents. And we will learn how easy it is to calculate normal probabilities.",
